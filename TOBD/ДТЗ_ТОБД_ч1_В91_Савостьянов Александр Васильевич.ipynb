Your ship – the pride and joy of any freebooter – can be customized in many ways. You are free to change almost everything – from the color of your flag and sails to the ship’s hull and figurehead. Of course, there are plenty of weapons to choose from for every battle, including cannons, mortars, flame throwers and so on. Also there are special tools ready to help you to rig the ship for any purpose. However, you can win the most valuable artifacts only by finishing the multilevel quests called “legends”. Good hunting.',\n",

Carlyetta Wesleigh once again seeks the PCs’ help to restore the earth temple of the Great Mother, which stands as testament to the ancient bond between the halflings and dwoerg of Picollo. The last temple of the goddess to be abandoned during the Hoyrall Wars, the Temple of Jewels and Mirrors, has been sealed for hundreds of years. From the nearby dwoerg city of Stone root a team of brave companions sets forth to prepare the site for sanctification by the priests of the newly-revived Devotees of the Four Hearts. Ignorance, deception, and the resurgence of a threat long thought eliminated from the shores of Picollo combine to frustrate the efforts of the intrepid band. Also Included in this adventure: Richly detailed relationships with recurring NPCs. Five new monsters, the Zagnatti: a race spawned from the mind of an alien god. A method to track the PCs’ influence on the future development of Picollan society. Notes on scaling for parties of 6 or more.

During Brian\\'s Time at Sintracorp, you will: Familiarize Yourself with Your Workspace: Use the elevator to discover who’s working and what’s lurking on every floor of Sintracorp.

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game 0-3 years old is the fastest growing phase of human beings which is very important for children. Children aged 0-3 years old feature great energy, good learning abilities, strong eagerness of learning and fast absorption of abound information. They can learn many languages at the same time that lays a good foundation for the language ability and other aspects of study in the future. We developed this game by absorbing the scientific research results of the current developmental psychology, multiple intelligence and games of early education for babies’ characteristics at this stage. The game conveys information to babies with text, images and audios, stimulating the infants’ brain synaptic connections, exercising babies’language abilities, perception, memory, creativity and imagination so that cultivate infants and young children's interest in reading, music and mathematics, etc.. Children’ brains will be more powerful and  more complete through scientific stimulation.  Features of the software: 1.Professional early education: It is tailored to children according to the learning characteristics of children aged 0-3 years old, which fully conforms to the scientific theoretical practice of development psychology, multiple intelligence and games of early education. 2.Bilingual teaching: By using two of the world's most widely used languages--English and Chinese as instruction languages which lays a better multilingual learning basis for children and broadens children’s international vision. 3.Time control: the software is set to study no more than half an hour, so that it can guarantee the baby's eyes would not be harmed. 4.Radom learning content: Babies can learn different things every time so that they will not be tired of the content. 5.Rich content: Looking, listening and thinking at the same time can develop children's language ability, ways of thinking, music, graphics, perception, memory and other abilities, comprehensively improve the babies’ multiple intelligence. 6.Studies have confirmed that watching a lot of entertainment programs will weaken the children’s learning interest. Our game has lovely game interface, delicate graphics, beautiful sound which make children happy. It can replace entertainment programs and cultivate baby's interest in learning, it lays a good foundation of learning for babies and let children win at the starting line.  In addition to this game, parents should do more contact and action games with infants and young children and give them suitable toys that match their ages and also take children out and do more outdoor and social activities.For example,when a baby can walk,water and sand are very good toys for them.They put on clothes that they are not afraid of getting dirty ,and they can be given more opportunities to play with water and sand on the premise of safety. Due to the tight development time and lack of experience, if there are any errors, please leave a comment or send us a E-mail to contact us and give us feedback. In the future, we will enrich the content of the software,and according to the parents’ feedback, we will constantly optimize the products, making the  game be the best tool of early education for 0-3 year-old babies, thank you!\",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game  Setting the scene It’s World War Two, and you’re in Egypt taking back lands claimed by the Nazis. You’re exploring an ancient Egyptian Chamber when you stumble upon a Nazi experiment in time travel gone wrong. The time gate has gone into reverse, pulling primal beasts from the past into the present. And your pal Tommy has been dragged through the portal. WTF? Play in VR and take on the role of Archie – one of the soldiers fighting for his life from the waves of marauding beasts, and struggling to save his friend. Battle the beasts with a WW2 submachine gun and as much ammo as you need in a frantic fight to the death, as you try to survive on limited health. But beware – the enemy can appear from anywhere around you and you’re their next tasty meal! With more content, levels and episodes to be added soon, this base version of the game will get you ready for the fight to come… Current Minimum PC Specs The current minimum specifications are based on our limited tests at ImmersiveVR, if you find it plays on your machine, which is a lower specifcation then the minimum, let us know! Development For us at ImmersiveVR, this has been a bit of fun we’ve been having in between our client projects. What started out at as a quick experiment in AI, turned into the chance to make a really fun, arcade-like and slightly wacky (Nazis, dinos, tombs anyone?) VR shooter game. There’s a few things we’ve put into this game that we are yet to see being done for a ground up VR game, such as cutscenes. Plus there are elements we plan to add that we feel will stand out from other games, such as the player seeing their character’s demise, without the nausea that VR can sometimes cause! And hopefully Primal Reign ups the quality expectations of VR games in terms of visuals, while keeping it fun and light-hearted. Features The game currently has a few simple features: 10 increasingly difficult waves or hordes of enemies trying to kill you 1 World War Two era sub-machine gun and access to a currently unlimited supply of magazines An ancient sword to defend yourself with 1 Word War Two era Fully Automatic Rifle and access to a currently unlimited supply of magazines Grenades! Some witty banter A teleporter to move you around the game The goal? To survive the waves and escape the ruins through the portal. If you fail? We’ll leave that up to the bad guys. Going Forward If this does really well both in the Steam Store, we’ll make more levels, different settings, different bad guys – the full works – and release an even bigger game. Is there any more to this game? This game is always evolving. We will constantly add, remove (remove less then we add!), change and update this game as we think of cool things to do with it, as well as respond to player feedback. We do plan to integrate more and more with Steam, by adding achievements and leader boards, so watch this space. Currently, there is just one level but if there’s interest for this sort of casual, arcade VR game – and this one in particular – we’ll design and add more levels. One last thing - building VR games has its challenges and there are a lot of limitations on what you can and can’t do – some of the visual limitations are the equivalent to game engines from 5-7 years ago! You’ve got to keep the polygon count as low as possible, keep lighting as simple as possible, and much more. All this means being inventive with the technology at hand and super-optimisation. Currently, VR games can’t have the graphics fidelity of a non-VR AAA FPS game. On our to-do list is working out the best optimisations so it looks great, plays great, but plays on as many VR rigs as possible. We do hope you enjoy our game, and hope you get it and allow us to share the fun..',\n",

You can pick up vases and candlesticks and throw them around for an exciting crash or chase after the rabbits to collect points. Like Alice in Wonderland, this family-friendly game explores shifting perspectives of large and small and you can jump through the looking glass for surreal adventures.  Discover a rabbit hole to uncover new scenes and characters both inside and outside the house. This game keeps expanding so if you haven’t been in recently, it is time to go back.

Background In an ancient time in China, the nine heroes (each was dubbed as Dragon), leading one\\'s respective clan, competed to become the One. Through numerous battles and wars, they competed. However, there was one event that drove everyone to doom, the War of Nine-Dragons. Some speculated that there were love-hate relationships among nine clans and their leaders. However, no one was able to provide the real answer that triggered such a tragic event, which caused all of nine clans to disappear from the land. Many years passed by, six clans which suffered relatively less from the War than others, resurfaced. And so, our story of Nine Dragons begins...',\n",

Though, having been trapped and experimented on for years, she'll use the full extent of her abilities and stealth skills to make it out in one piece. What is Geneticognito? Geneticognito is a 2D platformer with combat and stealth mechanics. Levels consist of hazards that can either damage Rane directly, or detect her. If Rane is detected, security robots will appear through doors, and the exit door to the level locks itself. Rane may fight the security robots and shoot them down, but unlimited amounts of robots will continue spawning while in Alert state. So stealth is important!\",\n",

Our hero\\'s patience and observation will be put to the test. Goal of the Game In this game we have an arcade style gameplay where the objective is to kill all the monsters in the level, if you get to reach the end or not, you will get your score based on monsters killed, accuracy, and critical hits performed.

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content Legions Triumphant expands Field of Glory II forwards five centuries from the first Emperor, Augustus, until 476 AD when the last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by his barbarian troops. You can be part of the final conquests of the Roman Empire in Britain, Germany and Dacia, and then the Pax Romana when the legions on the frontier mostly kept at bay the barbarians to the north and first the Parthians, then the Sassanid Persians, in the east. You can also witness the final disintegration of Western Roman power under pressure from the Germans and Goths (themselves attempting to outdistance the rising power of the Huns), and the desperate attempts of 5th century leaders to hold at bay the barbarian tide, using armies at least partly consisting of barbarian troops. Legions Triumphant follows the development of the Roman Imperial Army through its heyday, its late 3rd century AD reorganisation to deal with new threats, and subsequent decline. It also follows the rise of its various enemies, the Germans and Goths, the Sassanid Persians and the dreaded Huns. Summary of features 10 new factions 19 new units 24 new army lists 10 new Epic Battles 36 new Quick Battles Expanded Custom Battles module. Expanded Sandbox Campaign module. 4 new historically-based campaigns. Main build updated with major improvements to gameplay. Features 10 new factions: Alans, Anglo-Saxons, Caledonians, Goths, Hephthalites, Huns, Palmyrans, Picts, Romano-British and Sassanid Persians. 17 new units: Early Imperial Legionaries, Early Imperial Auxiliaries, Auxiliary Archers, Veteran auxiliary cavalry, Roman Lancers, Late Roman Lancers, Legio Palatina, Legio Comitatensis, Auxilia Palatina, Limitanii, Armoured Horse Archers, Expert Armoured Horse Archers, Fierce Nomad Horse Archers (Huns), Fierce Nomad Light Horse Archers (Huns), Irregular Foot (trousered), Pictish Spearmen and Jewish Zealots. Also the following that were available in the base game, but not used: Roman auxiliary cavalry, Sassanid levy spearmen. 22 new army lists (which together with 2 in the free patch, expands the total number of army lists to 132). 10 new Epic Battles: Watling Street 61 AD, Adamclisi 102 AD, Hormozdgan 224 AD, Emesa 272 AD, Argentoratum 357 AD, Maranga 363 AD, Adrianople 378 AD, Frigidus 394 AD, Chalons 451 AD, Nedao 454 AD (each playable from either side). 36 new Quick Battles (each playable from either side). With Legions Triumphant (together with the base game and Immortal Fire) the Custom Battles and the Sandbox Campaigns modules now include 132 army lists. 4 new historically-based campaigns: o   Third Century Crisis o   King of Kings (Sassanid Persia) o   Stilicho o   Empire of the Huns The free patch accompanying the release of Legions Triumphant includes major improvements to the campaign system. o   Ability to fight on after a lost battle. o   Maximum number of battles in sandbox campaigns increased, with more decision points and new possible decisions and events. o   Additional enemies in sandbox campaigns. You will need to fend off attacks by other enemies as well as advancing the campaign against your primary opponent. o   Units not only increase in quality following victories, but will upgrade to higher quality unit types when they reach the required quality. (e.g. Raw Pikemen > Pikemen > Veteran Pikemen). o   Anachronistic what if campaigns – by turning off the date and geographical filters you can set up sandbox campaigns between any two nations covered by the game from 550 BC to 476 AD. Additional enemies in the campaign will fit the date of the main enemy – so that it will be as if your army had been transported in time to a new era. Other major changes in the free patch: o   Improved AI. o   Evaders may suffer casualties even if they escape their pursuers. o   Chargers will now follow normal pursuit rules if their opponents break on contact. i.e. Infantry (apart from warbands and raw troops) will not pursue.',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content  Isabella Von Carstein In life, the daughter of Sylvania’s mad count Otto Von Drak was much like any other of her noble counterparts: vain, immoral and selfish. Upon her father’s death, the first and greatest of the Vampire counts, Vlad Von Carstein, seized the reigns of the province, and was duly married to Isabella. She was soon drawn to Vlad’s intense charisma, and he in turn came to rely upon her unquestioning support and devotion absolutely; what began as a marriage of convenience transformed into a partnership of legend. As she lay dying from a wasting disease, Vlad granted her the Blood Kiss, and she joined him in eternal undeath. Now, Isabella is a powerful Vampire in her own right, and may be seen stalking the front lines bearing the Blood Chalice of Bathori. When she joins Vlad on the same battlefield, their combat prowess is multiplied, each standing shoulder to shoulder with their beloved in death! Beginning play with ownership of Western Sylvania, Isabella may now be chosen to command a Grand Campaign as the leader of the Von Carstein family.  In addition, Vlad has been removed from the Vampire Counts faction select screen, and may now also be chosen to lead a Von Carstein campaign. Living legend : Isabella inspires Vampire Heroes in her retinue to unholy feats of combat prowess. Any Vampire Heroes in her retinue gain bonuses to their Melee Attack, Melee Defence and Weapon Damage statistics. Isabella can also field more Vampire heroes than any other Lord. Undying Love : Invigorated by each other’s presence, Isabella and Vlad gain bonuses to their melee attack and melee defence characteristics when they appear on the same battlefield. Quest Chain : Isabella may embark on a quest to attain the Blood Chalice of Bathori, her unique wargear item. In battle, this improves the weapon damage and regeneration of nearby allies. Loremaster : as a powerful Vampire Lord in her own right, Isabella wields the Lore of Vampires. Unholy handmaidens : Isabella begins play accompanied by two Vampire Heroes. ',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game  Description Birthdays are always days of change, even if we don't expect it. We get another year older, wiser, hopefully kinder and better, then we were just the day before. Birthdays can change everything about you, and about the world. Take mine, for instance. I had no idea when my friends came to celebrate just how things would end. I had no idea that a day begun with cake and presents, would end with a journey to stop an evil I had never heard of, a legend I didn't know, from destroying everyone and everything I ever cared about. I didn't know that on my birthday, I would have to embrace not only my destiny, but all my potential destinies, all of our potential destinies. Now me and my friends are exploring lost ruins, soaring through the sky on forgotten ships, and facing down monsters that I can barely imagine, and can just barely survive, all to prevent the very literal end of the world. Suddenly, getting older doesn't look so bad.

The limited number of balls means you'll have to play strategically in order to proceed. Designed for the HTC Vive. Features Smash ruins so large you'll have to look up to see them in their entirety. Destroy a certain percentage of each stage to clear it and move on to the next one. Ten kinds of ruins for you to destroy! The higher levels are stricter on the number of balls you get and the completion ratio you must reach. Aim carefully with one controller or make a big mess with two! Either way is a great stress reliever! How to Play Cause as much destruction as possible with as few balls as you can. The most efficient methods will require some planning! Think about where to start so that the resulting debris doesn't block your subsequent shots. The balls can ricochet. Take advantage of this to get a high score! You can adjust the angle of your shots by tilting your head or crouching. Unexpected positions can yield unexpected results. The game is playable from a sitting position, but it's more exciting while standing up!\",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game  Set on a dying alien world, Exocraft places you in command of your very own space mining fleet. Design custom spaceships, manage your crew members and wield the elemental powers of your army of worker drones to defeat the ancient guardians that litter the landscape. Engage in action-packed battles and use your strategy (and a bit of luck) to conquer the richest resource deposits throughout the dynamic world. Or, team up with friends to test your skills in competitive gameplay modes as part of this ever-growing open world full of danger and untold riches. BUILD CUSTOM SPACESHIPS Let your imagination run wild with nearly limitless combinations of ship parts, paints and other customizations to create your own unique spacecraft for strategy, looks and total domination. BATTLE FOR RESOURCES Command your arsenal of drones in epic space battles against ancient guardians for valuable resources. Compete with other pilots for the most valuable deposits of crystals, gems, elemental cores and scrap spacecraft parts, or team up with them to take on the most fearsome of opponents. GROW YOUR FLEET One mining spaceship is great, but in Exocraft you can design and build an entire fleet. Manage each starship’s crew members, control your elemental drones and expand your space mining empire to become the ultimate space tycoon. SURVIVE THE ALIEN LANDSCAPE This alien world is an unforgiving desert wasteland, and not everyone makes it out alive. Hone your skills and strategy as you build up your defenses to survive and prosper as the ultimate space mining fleet. TEAM UP WITH FRIENDS It’s dangerous to go alone into the vast desert. Dangers are at every turn, so team up with friends to take on the most dangerous and valuable of guarded mines. Or, enter your best spaceships in the competitive Team Race mode where you and others compete for the most resources in an exciting race against time. JOIN A SQUAD Build an alliance of the best pilots to challenge yourself to new heights as part of monthly tournaments and rankings. Squad chat helps you to organize around common goals and defeat your enemies with even more precision. DYNAMIC MULTIPLAYER WORLD Exocraft is a true massively multiplayer online game where your progression is saved and everyone shares the same massive world. Instead of splitting the world between servers like most IO games, the game world grows and shrinks to match the online players, meaning you can always play with everyone and compete for the same resources in a truly unique gaming experience.

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game Welcome to the futuristic and dangerous world of Glasswinged Ascension! As skilled operative, who possesses rare gift of so called Skepsiathy, you are to venture through top secret mission in goal to save innocent lives and uphold order.  This hardcore game doesn't leave you much room for mistakes, and creates checkpoints only in the very beginning of each mission. Stealth and caution are your best friends here, as enemies require just one shot to kill you, there are a lots of deadly traps around, and even environment itself may become real problem if you will not proceed carefully. Obviously, not all rushed actions will become fatal, but they may still weaken you increasing chances to fail. Enemies are stronger, and once they'll spot you, they'll act fast and without hesitation, so what you will need to do is to outplay them tactically. Stay out of their sight, use sneaking stance to move around without making any noise, or turn off the lights to limit their visual detection capabilities. You will have both lethal and non-lethal weapons at your disposal. Kill enemies, disable them for a short period of time, or even sneak around without firing a single shot - it's fully up to you how to deal with the threat.  Game's missions are not linear, so you will always have alternate routes. Keep in mind that all tripmines you've disarmed along your way can be used to destroy weak walls or floor, while exoskeletons will allow you to lift and move heavy objects or even pass through hazardous environments unharmed. Each mission pushes the story forward, so be sure to read all dialogues you'll encounter. Even though dialogues themselves are pretty linear, they are helping to build truly cyberpunk atmosphere, and give you some interesting themes to think about.\",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game \"Ghost\" is a metroidvania where two super hackers hire a mysterious agent in order to infiltrate the Nakamura Space Station and steal the greatest electronic secret ever. Of course, the space station will defend itself, which is where the fun begins: the station\\'s defences, with their never-ending arsenal of weapons and artifacts, will have to be destroyed. But the story gets more complicated when the hackers find out about their agent\\'s hidden ties...  WEAPONS: Weapons reload on the go and they never run out of bullets. No need to hoard ammo for the boss battle! The various weapons can be found or purchased (depending on the game mode) and each one has its strengths and weaknesses.  GHOST: The protagonist is not the android you see, but the being that remotely controls it: a mysterious digital ghost that can leave its robot chassis, pass through doors and walls, control enemy androids, and use their own tools against them. What happens if the robot you control gets destroyed, you ask? Then your ghost will be free to control something else, or return to your main body.  UPGRADES: You can have as many as you can collect. The upgrades are passive, so they work without needing any special controls, and they don\\'t run out or deactivate. They come in a large assortment, from aggressive drones to bullet improvements. Remember that the more you get, the more OP you are.  ITEMS: Devices you can use at any time. High-tech equivalents to potions and scrolls.  GEEKIES: Spread throughout the game are hidden \"geekies\". If you find one and activate it, something related to that geekie will change in the game (not affecting gameplay)... and the challenge is to find out what changes. I know, it sounds silly, but some of them are funny.  SECRETS: 200 rooms have secrets in them that can be revealed by performing a specific action. If you find a secret, you\\'re rewarded with a small permanent powerup that will make your character more powerful. In addition, finding all of the secrets in each level will reward you with something very special.  MAP: The whole map has around 300 rooms, divided into zones. Each zone has its own enemies, its own ambience, its own soundtrack, and, of course, its own boss.  STORY: The story is not to save the world, but rather to go on an intruiging journey wrought with humor. Not to mention all the dialogues and cinematics, all voiced in English.  GAME MODES: Ghost has 2 game modes: \"classic\" and \"survival\". Classic is similar to a metroidvania, where the more you advance through the game, the more stuff you obtain and the harder the enemies become. Survival is crazier, as you get stuff much faster and you\\'ll soon turn into a killing machine, but you lose everything when you die.  SKILL TREE: The RPG component of the game is found in the skill tree, where you can spend skill points to level up characters, obtaining special skills for each one. Depending on what skills you select, your gameplay will change in an interesting way.  And the rest is a mystery, one that I shouldn\\'t spoil... you\\'ll just have to discover the rest on your own.',\n",

However, certain entities in the Energy Realm have evolved into matter-less sentient beings. The game’s kitten protagonist (a cat-shaped energy entity) and spirits are all examples of such beings. Pure energy entities can travel freely between the two realms. The story of WENJIA thus unfolds… WHAT'S NEW Huge amount of interactive elements, like: animals, traps, etc. New storyline and new music were added We adjusted the game's difficulty, it will be a little bit more challenge, but you can still download the Easy Mode Pack for free Game animation adjustment Game resource optimization To help players get familiar with WenJia's world,we put in a  clearer tutorial than before Process optimization when interacting with animals A forest’s longstanding tranquility is shattered by a sudden earthquake. As lava bursts forth from the ground, the mountain’s spirits find themselves surrounded by fiery death.

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game The year is 1291 and the crusades have come to an end. Off in a far away country a lone crusader makes his return journey back to his homeland. He decides to pass through an unfamiliar forest, but little does he know that it is a Forest Of Evil! A Knight of the crusades who specialized in assassination has decided to make a return journey back to his homeland now that the wars which he had been called to have come to an end. At the point of his journey where this game begins we find him traveling alone and deciding to pass through a large forest which is unfamiliar to him. He is in no hurry to return to his homeland and prefers his own company, so he thinks nothing of taking the long path through unfamiliar lands. However, he is about to stumble upon a land consumed by a Deep Darkness. Will he have the strength to overcome this Eternal Night? Can he tear through the Veil of Evil which covers this land and bring forth the Light of a New Dawn? Or, will he succumb to the Darkness and fall like all those who had lived in this land before his arrival? CAUTION: This game is intended to be very difficult. If you aren\\'t looking for a challenge then this game may not be for you. A Quote From A Play-Tester: \"This game is hard as *&#$^@#*%$#! But every time I rage quit in frustration I find myself coming back for the satisfaction of the challenge!\" Game-play Synopsis Forest of Evil is a 2D Platformer partially inspired by games like the 1990s Castlevania. Although, it is fairly distinct from those games so one shouldn\\'t compare them to Forest of Evil. Play through 9 unique levels each with their own unique boss. However, the player only needs to complete 5 levels to beat the game as the levels diverge at points into different paths from which the player may choose the course they feel best for them in order to continue. One therefore would need to play through the game multiple times and take different paths to experience every level and boss. Think about each level carefully and decide which weapon would best suit the enemies and boss within it. By default you will always have a dagger, but there are 5 other weapons which may be acquired through breaking weapon crates scattered within each level and each weapon has its own unique usage. You have 4 tries to complete each level before it is GAME OVER! But, you will be able to continue from the start of each level provided that you saved at the previous saving Cross. The riggors of the paths getting you down? Not finding the weapon you want in the crates or perhaps you have need of some armor? Find a gold coin hidden within each level and spend them as you desire when browsing the many goods held by the creepy wandering merchant; one of the few souls seemingly unaffected by the Forest\\'s Deep Evil. Keep an eye out for the kindly wizard. He may help you on your journey by offering a wish. But, is there more to him than may be seen at first glance? This game is for those who desire a challenge. It is intended to be very difficult and this needs to be understood going in. So, if you feel that you are dying quite often, falling down holes that you thought you shouldn\\'t have fallen down, are having a difficulty getting through even the first level or two, this is intended! If you are resilient and just keep trying, you will defeat it one day. But if not, then you will succumb to the Darkness and fall like many before you. Once you beat the game you will unlock a HARD MODE which you may play through if you felt the base game wasn\\'t difficult enough and require a greater challenge! A BOSS RUSH MODE will be unlocked once you have defeated each of the 9 bosses. You do not have to play all the way through the game and defeat the final boss each time while taking different paths, but must simply have gotten to and defeated every single boss once. And saved having done so of course. Support! This game causing you to feel a bit low in the ground? Experiencing some problems with bugs or glitches? Having trouble with some spot? Or just want to give some constructive criticisms? Then please feel free to make a post in the discussions section of this game\\'s community hub! You may also feel free to send a message to our official support email which can be found either by going through the Steam Support process online or by finding the discussion post in the discussions section of this game\\'s community hub which will show it. About the Game\\'s Development and Development Team This game was created by an independent 3 person development team of brothers in spare time over the course of approximately 1 year. One person uses the pixel software \"Aesprite\" to create the sprites and pixel art and also composes the unique music. The second uses \"Unity 2D\" to bring it all together with the coding\\\\programing. And the third offers encouragement, testing, criticisms, manages the store page, keeps track of discussions posted on the discussions page, and other support when needed.',\n",

Travel from the safe refuge of your farm through a series of regions progressively more affected by the infernal plague.  On the road, rescue survivors and choose whether to use them as traveling companions or to improve the Doctor's farm and gain access to new abilities. How your farm progresses depends upon where you assign survivors to work.  Some survivor types are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful still if kept available for expeditions. Surviving the road will rely on your ability to fight horrors created by the plague, in combat encounters featuring grid-based positioning and turn-based strategy mechanics.  Traverse four regions with procedurally generated stages, featuring richly illustrated 2D art, music from award-winning composer Sean Beeson and narration performed by Jim Sterling.\",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content  Western Pacific’s Feather River Canyon route is one of the most famous, scenic, and highly-engineered railroad lines in all of North America. The Western Pacific was a late comer to America’s railroad scene – WP was not incorporated to build its main line from Salt Lake City to the San Francisco Bay Area until 1903, and its final spike was not driven until 1909. As a result, the Western Pacific was constructed to exceptional engineering standards that featured numerous high trestles, bridges, and tunnels, and a routing that topped the rugged Sierra Nevada Mountains with an eastbound ruling grade of 1 percent. Train Simulator’s Feather River Canyon route recreates the dramatic Western Pacific main line from Oroville to Quincy Junction, California, as it existed in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the route also includes a segment of the Inside Gateway (Western Pacific’s important connection with the Great Northern and later Burlington Northern) from Keddie to Crescent Mills, as well as the trackage of the lumber-hauling Quincy Railroad short line. The route brings to life the remarkable locations and features of the Feather River Canyon, including famous Keddie Wye and Spanish Creek trestle, bustling Oroville yard and roundhouse, the iconic rail and road bridges of Pulga, and the nearly countless tunnels, such as the “Honeymoon Tunnels” near Belden, that Western Pacific’s visionary builders used to form the WP into a railroad engineering marvel. Included with the Feather River route are General Electric U30B and EMD F7 diesels in Western Pacific’s flashy orange and silvery livery and a selection of period-authentic freight rolling stock including a Western Pacific bay-window caboose. Scenarios Seven career scenarios and eight railfan scenarios are included for the route: Keddie Consignment: Part 1 Keddie Consignment: Part 2 Keddie Consignment: Part 3 Crescent Mills to Keddie Oroville Bound: Part 1 Oroville Bound: Part 2 Oroville Bound: Part 3 Plus 8 railfan scenarios More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game. Train Simulator’s Steam Workshop scenarios are free and easy to download, adding many more hours of exciting gameplay. With scenarios being added daily, why don’t you check it out now!

As a creature of ultimate evil, you don't ask for much... just to raze the odd kingdom, and have your cache of all-powerful magical gems safely hidden away. Too bad the (ugh) good guys are out to steal them. Using the powers of the orcs, demons, and undead, you'll build unique and powerful towers along paths to destroy any hero that dares get close. Upgrade your undead cemeteries to instill fear in foes that makes them flee in the opposite direction, or turn your demonic temples into mighty icons capable of turning the ground to lava beneath anyone's feet. You'll upgrade and enhance each unique type, and of course, unlock spells of your own to enter the fray... when the going gets tough, the tough drop meteors on everyone else, after all. Sure, your enemies have paladins and angels and ninjas and more, but when you've got power like yours, they'll wish they stayed at home. Cursed Treasure 2 is casual but engaging tower-defense with style, packed with 24 levels that can be conquered normally or in Night Mode for even more challenge. It's good to be bad. Three powerful and monstrous tower-types, each with their own unique skills to unlock! 24 levels of maniacal mayhem across a lush fantasy world. Replay stages in Night Mode with limited illumination for added challenge. Earn ability points to improve everything from spells to towers and more. A wide variety of enemies tricky powers and abilities to overcome. A vibrant and colorful style... just because you're evil doesn't mean you can't look good. \",\n",

Taking in the complete lack of civilization, you bravely set on a fruitless search for food and shelter.  Finally, you decide you'd be better off being hit by lightning from the storm that seems to rolling over the island than to stay on this nameless clump of dirt. Controls: Arrow keys to move. Highlighted keys to execute actions. Space to skip dialog boxes. Explore the island, you might find things that prolong your miserable existence. Surviving a single day in GRIT: 1) Count every calorie! You'll need them, most commands will have time and calories it will take to execute them. 2) Gather some wood, build yourself a shelter and add some fuel to the fire, that will keep you warm during storms. 3) Explore the island, you might find some ways to get off the island (building a raft on the shore would be one of them.. the rest you'll have to find on your own). 4) If you have two edible items and have made a bowl out of stone, you'll be able to cook a meal at your camp (provided the fire has some wood in it).\",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content One of the most powerful passenger steam locomotives ever to be built for the British railway network – the Coronation Class ‘Duchess of Sutherland’ – comes to Train Simulator in its fantastically preserved BR Brunswick Green livery. The Stanier-designed ‘Big Lizzies’ (as they were often nicknamed by their Enginemen) were an enlarged version of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway’s Princess Royal Class. Several examples were original built as streamlined, but this was later removed. They were, quite simply, a beast of British steam traction – the Class was estimated to produce 3,300 horsepower and weighed 105 tons with a coal fuel capacity of nine tons and carrying 4,000 gallons of water. Their prestigious standing saw many of the Class head express steam passenger services across the LMS network from the mid-1930s through to their withdrawal in the mid-1960s. ‘Duchess of Sutherland’ was outshopped in July 1938 as part of the third batch of her Class. During her 25 years of service, she ran 1.6m miles – the second highest mileage by any member of her Class. The locomotive was withdrawn from mainline service in 1964 but never saw a scrapyard, instead being purchased by a Butlins holiday camp in Scotland and then by a Steam Museum. Since 1996, she has been owned by the Duchess Trust and is in regular use on rail tours across the country. The Duchess of Sutherland for Train Simulator is available in BR Brunswick Green livery and is a former Iron Horse House model, which has been updated to Train Simulator standard, including new scenarios and improved exterior modelling. Features of the locomotive include AWS for mainline running, steam chest pressure gauge, live steam injector steam valve, headlights, cylinder cocks, opening firebox doors, and fireman’s and driver’s light. Also included are BR Mk1 coaches in maroon livery. The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Duchess of Sutherland on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Settle-Carlisle route (available separately and required to play these scenarios). Scenarios Four scenarios for the Settle-Carlisle route: Training: Duchess Simple Controls Training: Duchess Expert Controls Evening Commute to Carlisle Uphill Battle More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game. Train Simulator’s Steam Workshop scenarios are free and easy to download, adding many more hours of exciting gameplay. With scenarios being added daily, why don’t you check it out now!

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game Design clothing and romance a guy of your choice. Tailor Tales is an otome that has you playing an aspiring fashion designer who runs her own boutique. Set in a fictional European country, her life gets complicated when she meets a certain guy in a fateful encounter. Throughout the game she'll be required to design clothes for clients to earn enough gold to purchase the next chapter of the story. Customize your main character and choose whether to be 'fierce' or 'kind' with your guy. Perhaps you'd like to kiss him first, or would rather he take the lead; it's all your choice and there are no bad endings! Each guy has his own unique route so you can jump right in and experience a completely different story. Features Design your own clothes Customize the main character and dress her up Decorate your boutique Read romantic stories about a bachelor of your choosing Choose whether to act fierce or kind 2 endings for each bachelor (no bad endings!) 9 CGs per bachelor Partial voice acting Completely unique stories with no common route 4-5 hours of gameplay per route, or about 100k words per character Blinking sprites and CGs, plus animated mouths Night mode version for light on dark reading And it's free to play! Tailor Tales will have 6 routes in the future and will get updated with each new finished route–there are currently 2 completed routes! The love interests Tailor Tales is all about the romance, so here's an introduction to the eligible guys: Neil is wealthy, prickly, and doesn't really want to interact with you. When you met Neil in your childhood–a memory he's very fond of–he mistook you for a boy. Now that you're an adult, he doesn't quite know how to deal with you. Be whisked away in his awkward charms, visiting masquerade balls and the opera. Complete Dimitri is the younger brother of your ex that cheated on you. When Dimitri is a college student and looking for a room to rent, you somehow end up inviting him to live at your boutique. He's sweet, easily flustered, and loves to cook for you. But he's also 4 years younger than you! Maybe living together will bring you closer. Complete Caine is a slippery thief with no tact. When you see him getting bullied at his part time job, you take pity on him and help him out. While he can be loud, rude, and unable to really express how he feels, Caine just needs a little push in the right direction–even thieves can get lonely. Coming up next! In an alternate reality where people have superpowers, you design costumes for superheroes. James has the ability to fly but one day he literally crashes in front of your boutique. James looks like he'd rather throw you off a skyscraper than listen to you. He's stoic and rarely expresses his emotions. But then, you get kidnapped... Coming in the future Aiden is chatty, kind of flirty, and makes you laugh–online, that is. You meet Aiden playing a popular online game and you want to meet up. Except when you do finally meet him, you realize... you've been catfished! In reality, Aiden is a bumbling fool whose social anxiety forces him to keep running away from your wrath. Coming in the future Sam is kind and loves to hand out compliments to everyone. He promises his hair salon is legitimate, but you think something fishy is going on when all of his employees look suspiciously like criminals. Sam loves to touch your hair and take care of you. He promises to protect you in the event a certain shady person tries to hurt you. Coming in the future \",\n",

Your task is to get out of this accursed place at all costs, but it will not be easy. From there more no one came back, everyone froze in the ice, died of hunger or they were overtaken by creatures that live in these places. Search food, water and warm places to not freeze and not die. In the game there are three indicators - thirst, hunger and cold, if one from the indicators will be at zero, then you are waiting for death, watch them so as not to perish. Look for sheets with tips left by people who were there before. There are two ways to get out of this cold prison, find one of them and overcome all obstacles standing in your way. Also in the game there are several puzzles that you have to decide in order to survive. In this game, there are several modes: 1) Escape mode, you need to get out of the area to which you will get, using hints scattered through out all locations in the forest. 2) Survival mode, it will be added to the game a little later together with the cooperative mode of the game so you can play with your friends and pass all levels together. In the mode of survival, you must last as long as possible in severe winter conditions: create shelters, look for food and water, create new equipment that allows you to stay longer сold and much more.',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game DUNGEONS OF CHAOS is a tribute to the 2D turn-based pixelart RPGs of the 80s.  A game where you can create your party of 6 characters with a few clicks, or spend more time creating a customised party with feats unlocked in previous plays.  Where exploration is encouraged and rewarded, with no level cap, non-linear side quests and a vast array of items, item properties, shops and enemies.  The game already has over 30000 happy players on other platforms, and most often they mention the likeness to 80s RPGs like Ultima or the goldbox games.  It is retro.  Your hand will not be held.  It does not try to have realistic 3D graphics.  It is not multiplayer, and never will be.  If you long for the days when you traded your sleep for a chance to direct a party of adventurers through pixelated lands of exploration and battle glory, then you may want to give it a try.  And as all existing players already know, all fans and myself help out with tips and tricks, mostly on the facebook page but also on my blog if you prefer that.  I do not provide or encourage having a complete-detail wiki somewhere, as the fan interaction on questions and strategy are a very enjoyable part of the game.  So come join our community of DoC addicts and play a game where a troll is still a hairy monster you can kill, where there are no level caps, where you are not confined by a slim storyline path, and where it all starts with fighting rats in a cave/cellar.  Fans have usually spent anything upwards of 80 hours playing it.  P.S.: apologies in advance for the puns in the game, but to my defence some were added by fans so if it is a bad joke you are reading on some tombstone or note just pretend it's from a fan and not me.  ;-)  P.P.S.: I am very open to fixing bugs or typos. But I mostly use British English, so don't flag non-American English spelling/syntax please.\",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game  \"There are submarines, and then there are targets...\" They are out there, in the vast expanse of the sea. You don\\'t see them, and you\\'re not supposed to; they reveal themselves only reluctantly, when in port or transiting a shallow passage. They\\'ve grown from an unsuccessful, almost laughable nuisance, to a practical weapon in fleet battles, to the scourge of seaborne transport lines, and ultimately to mobile undersea fortresses that can end life on the planet in less than 10 minutes. A junior branch compared to their centuries-old naval surface warfare counterparts, submarines have nevertheless seen and done it all, both in peacetime and wartime. And it takes a special kind of people to handle and operate them - for one, claustrophobics and fragile nerves need not apply. These people often share more in common with their direct adversaries from foreign, even hostile nations than with their comrades in the other services. Like their boats, they are discreet, persistent and deadly. They are submariners. They are The Silent Service. Undersea warfare from post-WW2 to the present: Explore the progression of submarine operations from the Korean War right up to today\\'s headlines. Witness first-hand how technological advances like the snorkel, nuclear power, cruise and ballistic missiles, silencing measures and advanced sonars, computers and torpedoes have radically expanded both the remit and capabilities of the submarine platform - and how its hunters on the surface and in the air improved their own gear and tactics to keep up in the race. Stars and workhorses: Take charge of some of the most famous boats and classes of the post-war period - and some that you may have never heard of. USS Nautilus, the first-ever nuclear-powered submarine - and her counterparts beyond the Iron Curtain, the November-class. HMS Swiftsure, nemesis of the Soviet Northern Fleet in \\'77. USS Parche, the most highly decorated vessel in the US Navy. Sturgeon-, Los Angeles- and Seawolf-class, frontline of the US sub force from the 1960s to the late-00s. Soviet/Russian conventional and nuclear-powered attack subs, worthy adversaries of NATO during the Cold War and beyond. Giants of the deep like the carrier-killer Oscar-class and the ballistic missile-toting Delta-class. And much more... The busiest platform at sea: If you thought subs are only good for sinking ships and other subs, prepare to be amazed. Lay minefields right on the enemy\\'s backyard with them being none the wiser. Launch carefully-plotted cruise missile attacks against defended land targets. Creep up to surface vessels close enough that you can take underwater hull and screw photos - and remain undetected. Detect and record sensitive electronic emissions, the ones that radar/comms operators dare activate only when they think nobody\\'s around to sniff. Provide unseen escort to merchant ships in the middle of a crisis. Shower distant land targets with ballistic missiles armed with multiple nuclear warheads. Tap undersea communications cables in the worst moment of the Cold War. Covertly deliver special-operations teams ashore, or deploy swimmer delivery vehicles (SDVs) against capital ships to eliminate them out of the blue. And of course hunt down anything on the sea surface or underneath it, from miniscule patrol boats all the way to battleships, supercarriers and strategic missile submarines, using an array of torpedoes, missiles and other means. The depths are your domain - and your playground. The Silent Service is a standalone expansion for Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations, 2013\\'s Digital Wargame of the Year: play as a single, separate game, or add it to your collection of scenarios for CMANO. Eighteen standalone scenarios, played either in ascending difficulty or chronological order, walk you through the nuances of modern submarine operations, in control of a wide range of submarine classes from both the East and West, in conditions ranging from peacetime to crisis to all-out war. Can you fill the shoes of the legends of The Silent Service? FEATURES: * A standalone expansion for Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations, 2013\\'s Wargame of the Year: play as a single, separate game, or add it to your collection of scenarios for CMANO * 18 intense standalone scenarios written by Rory Noonan, CMANO community veteran: Each scenario is accompanied by era-authentic mission briefings placing you into the scene of action * A wide range of introductory tutorials, designed to teach you how to get into the game in an approachable and accessible way * Underwater warfare utilizing CMANO\\'s award-winning simulation engine - with new wrinkles specific to the submarine domain',\n",

He is incredibly skilled in close quarters combat, robust, violent, and has a variety of physical attacks to crush any resistance. A water type overlord, Terbang is equipped with gravity emitters that allow her to float.  While the fastest overlord, her attacks are not as strong as her brothers. She uses projectiles to attack and is able to charge her attack to create a massive power attack. One of the strongest overlords, Phemus does not travel at high speeds, but due to his four arms is able to deal massive damage at close range. A hulking walking armour with two massive arms and tentacle-like protuberances as hair, he has a devastating spin attack which can be incredibly dangerous combined with a boost at the right time.

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game Lunaform is a puzzle arcade game like breakout, but instead of destroying all of the blocks your trying to fill them up. Swap the hexes just in time to catch stars of the same color, and fill up the grid to complete the level. Sounds easy at first, but later on increasingly complex star patterns emerge, and the hex grid gets larger as you work on harder planets. Your goal is to finish constructing the solar system by building each planet, accomplished by beating each level. 36 levels 6 upgrades 5 planets, 1 hidden 2-3 hours of gameplay Windows/Mac/Linux works well with touch screens Mechanics, Hexes, and Stars: Click to swap hexes and catch stars of the same color and fill them up. Hexes need 3 hits to be filled, and 5 to be destroyed. Click and hold to speed up all of the stars Bumper Hexes change the direction of stars to get hard to reach hexes, or divert opposite color stars Locked Hexes create a challenge by letting the player find ways to fill them without swapping them directly Core Hex is a hex that must be protected, if it gets destroyed then your planet forming fails Bigger grids with multiple colors, where some hexes must be destroyed, and some must be filled. The challenge comes from what you choose to destroy, as it changes your position and what you are vulnerable to Normal Stars fill a matching color hex by 1, or damage an opposite hex by 1 Nova Stars explode in a radius to fill or damage multiple hexes by 1 Suns has 2 normal stars rotating around it, fills a matching color hex by 2, or damages an opposite hex by 2 Arc Stars move in an unpredictable arc filling or damaging hexes by 1 Upgrades: Time Stop - Stops all star movements, to give you a few seconds to swap hexes freely Shield - Puts up a barrier around hexes to prevent them from being damaged by the opposite colored stars Shield Swap - Whenever you swap two of the hexes, it shields them both for a small amount of time Star Barrier - Produces a moving barrier that changes the color of the stars Hex Splash - When a hex is full, if it gets hit by the same color stars it will begin to fill adjacent hexes Star Sweeper - Clears all the stars on the screen ',\n",

At a time when all the surrounding creatures were of one particular color, our protagonist was immediately of all colors at once. Because of it, he was subjected to the worst that was in this world – colorism. For many years Willie The Wheel was chased by everyone, he had no work, no family, no friends. Life drove him to the dead end, and at that moment he met a stranger – he was just like Willie, unlike the others, but unlike Willie, who represented all the colors at once, his new acquaintance didn’t have any color at all. He handed Willie a leaflet with an invitation to an incredible place where our hero could prove to everyone his importance and strength – Neon Coliseum.  Take control of our incredible hero! Use your uniqueness and create color lasers to destroy enemies, but don’t forget that you have to run after the cartridge after discharge. Test your skills and try to score as many points as possible, but the more you destroy the enemies, the more is your fame, and hence more hunters will come to your soul.',\n",

Now you have the choice of pursuing this dark truth or trying to bury it in the past. Maybe it’s not too late to turn back now. -- Blackout is a dark themed Choose Your Own Adventure game, influenced by White Wolf’s World of Darkness , H.P. Lovecraft and weird shows like Twin Peaks . In Blackout , you have 3 attributes that will change during the game: Courage, Sanity and Fitness . These attributes will also lock or unlock choices or paths, as will some items you may acquire along the way. Blackout is a game about hidden monsters and hidden fears, and ultimately about overcoming the worst adversary: one’s true self . You play as a man who finds himself lost in a dark street somewhere in the city of New Wenders. It doesn’t take long before you start having flashbacks and regaining your memory. Something terrible happened, and you were part of it. This event somehow opened your eyes to a whole new world that has been hiding beneath the shadows. As the player, you have the choice to dig deeper into this unspeakable deed or try to leave it all behind. Blackout is a game about choices , every chapter of the game takes place in a different location, and the order in which the chapters take place will change based on your choices.

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game To play the game 'straight' you would reach each successive exit until you surmount a final challenge. Action-driven puzzle elements encourage exploration and backtracking, and could lead you to alternative routes, or simply spice up the game world based on your choices. Tools and 'Crafting' Tools are strewn across the levels, and are sometimes tied to narrative outcomes. Activate two tools simultaneously to 'combine' them at the touch of a button, on-the-fly, to maintain the momentum of play. For example: while wielding a pole, activate your spring as well to instantly have a pogo stick, then also activate a spike to have a pogo-drill that destroys terrain as you bounce. Food Food works in much the same way. For example: combine a sprig of death-fern with a haunch of fresh meat for a somewhat... nourishing morsel. Player-Driven Endings Uncover narrative threads that mutate the game world and on occasion lead you to alternative routes. For example: you may choose to help a creature. They may lay an egg. The egg may hatch. The hatchling may follow you. A few events down the line and this creature could influence a unique ending for you. It may simply add flavour to the usual route. The point is that you make action-based decisions that mutate the game world. Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/arborealgames Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/arborealgames Features Randomly generated levels Combine tools for varied on-use effects and movement styles Action-driven narrative choice Real-time 2D shadows make the experience much more tactical (which is a lot more important than it sounds) Extensive tutorial Playable with an X-Box gamepad (Recommended actually) Design Goals Ultimate replay value. Loads of possible equipment combinations. To utilise the core mechanics of picking up, dropping, combining, storing, using, and consuming tools for as many aspects of play as possible, to prevent a disjointed experience. Multiple methods for tackling multiple potential goals. To an extent, you loosely define these goals yourself. Through mastery of the game's mechanics and equipment combinations, moment-to-moment gameplay decisions and goals shift from simple wanderlust to deliberate strategy. \",\n",

Then, he'd inflate the safety buoys, rie to the surface, and pass the hat. When the Kraken of Titan started to retrofit their submarine vessels for space travel, the Nautilon proved to be surprisingly sturdy and effective in harsh conditions. \",\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Content  Total War: WARHAMMER – The Grim & The Grave The Grim & The Grave is the first Lords Pack for Total War: WARHAMMER. Bolstering the forces of both The Empire and The Vampire Counts, it introduces famous rival characters and new iconic units from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles to your campaigns and battles. Two new Legendary Lords… …with new quest chains, magic items and skill trees Two new additional Lord types Five all-new battlefield units plus variants Five new battlefields for custom battles and multiplayer battles 18 elite Regiments of Renown Ever-devious and ever-ruthless, the Unliving Aristocracy summons forth horrifying new threats to unman the forces of The Empire. Smelling blood on the tainted air, the Strigoi Ghoul Kings stir from their stale catacombs, while Mannfred’s darkest student, Helman Ghorst, pauses in his damnable studies and readies the Corpse-Carts for battle. But the proud men of The Empire do not stand idly by in the face of such unholy threats. Even now the call goes out, and all eyes turn to Volkmar The Grim, Grand Theogonist of The Cult of Sigmar. Pious and forbidding, Karl Franz’ staunchest ally calls forth his Arch Lectors and rides into battle on the War Altar of Sigmar, a sight to strike terror even into the unbeating hearts of The Undead. Man versus vampire: legend versus legend. The Grim and The Grave. New Legendary Lords Volkmar The Grim Volkmar The Grim is the Grand Theogonist, the head of the Cult of Sigmar and the most powerful religious leader in the Empire. He is a pious and foreboding man who is utterly devoted to the destruction of Chaos in all its forms. When he accompanies an army into battle, he typically rides atop the resplendent War Altar of Sigmar, inspiring the soldiers around him to great acts of heroism as he strikes the followers of evil down with powerful blows and words of divine force. Volkmar is a holy terror on the battlefield, a man who fights with the fury of Sigmar himself. It is said that his soul is forged of steel, and he fights the malign influence of Chaos with every fibre of his being. Campaign bonuses When Volkmar leads a Grand Campaign, any Flagellant you recruit into his army will gain improvements to their weapon damage and charge bonus stats, and will be cheaper to recruit. Quests Volkmar may embark on quests to earn his Legendary items. The Jade Griffon provides a passive augment that regenerates Volkmar’s health, while the Staff of Command brings a number of improvements to Volkmar’s combat skills, public order management and post-battle loot income. Battle prayers Volkmar can unlock three Grand Battle Prayers to utter in combat, improving the offensive and defensive capabilities of himself and those around him. Unique mount When Volkmar has unlocked his Battle Prayers, he gains access to the War Altar of Sigmar, a resplendent fighting platform replete with a vast bronze Griffon bearing Ghal Maraz. Unique Skills Volkmar has the unique skills Para Bellum Aeturnus and Heretic Hunter, which improve the abilities of Flagellants and Warrior Priests in both battle and campaign. Helman Ghorst Helman Ghorst was once a man, yet that life was ripped from him. The loss of his father and brothers to plague sent Ghorst into an obsessive madness; he began studying the black arts in the hope of returning his lost kin to life. Coming to the attention of Mannfred von Carstein, the Count taught him necromancy, transforming Helman into something beyond the grief-maddened man from Templehof. Now, he is carried through the night on a bone-ridged cart, pulled not by horses, but by the brothers he so desperately wished to save – each a once-handsome farrier restored to a mockery of life, forced to stumble along at the head of their brother’s unloving host. Campaign bonuses When chosen to lead a Grand Campaign, Helman Ghorst confers a bonus to the casualty replenishment rate of all Vampire Counts armies. In addition, all units in Helman Ghorst’s army gain poison attacks. Quests Helman may embark upon a quest for The Liber Noctus, a legendary tome which weakens his enemies in battle, and enables him to use special abilities more frequently. Unique Mount Helman may unlock The Brothers Ghorst Corpse Cart. Drawn by the undead remnants of his brothers, this unique mount vastly improves his weapon strength and damage output. Unique Spell Awaken from the Grave, Helman’s unique spell, summons a unit of Grave Guard or, when upgraded, a Wight King to fight for him. Unique Skills Helman has the unique skill Leading from the Front which improves abilities of the plague-bearing Corpse Carts and the phantasmal Mortis Engine. New Lords Arch Lector The High Priest of the Cult of Sigmar is the Grand Theogonist, and beneath him are his two Arch Lectors - grim, imposing figures, both on and off the battlefield. It is the duty of Arch Lectors to protect the populace and cast out evil. They epitomise the warrior courage of Sigmar himself, leading from the front where they manifest the power of the gods and inspire whole armies to acts of heroism. Battle prayers Arch Lectors can learn three Grand Battle Prayers to aid their armies in combat. Hammer of Sigmar improves the Arch Lector’s melee attack skill. Shields of Faith is an area-effect augment for nearby allies, improving their damage resistance. Soulfire is a large area-effect offensive power, causing mass magical damage to enemy units. Strigoi Ghoul King The pallid creatures known as Ghoul Kings are in fact once-proud Strigoi Vampires forced into a troglodytic existence. Though all Strigoi descend from the same ancient lineage of Ushoran, they have devolved to become something far fouler and more hate-filled than their brethren. The Ghoul Kings spend their days creeping through the hidden places of the world, but under cover of night, they wreak their vengeance at the head of a shambling army of Undead. Powerful warriors and spellcasters, Strigoi Ghoul Kings wield a mixed lore combining spells from the Lore of Vampires and the Lore of Death, and may unlock and ride Terrorgheists into battle. Unique Spell Command of The Unliving, the Strigoi Ghoul King’s unique spell, summons a unit of Crypt Ghouls or, when upgraded, a unit of Crypt Horrors to fight for him in battle. New Units Corpse Cart Drawn by shambling zombies, Corpse Carts act like magnets for Dark Magic, drawing their power from the land itself and re-animating the dead around them. Sometimes a Corpse Cart is hung with a great bell, the clapper of which is a fell lodestone of eldritch provenance. When necromantic magic is thick in the air, the bell tolls and ripples of Dark Magic emanate from the Corpse Cart. As a magical support chariot, the Corpse Cart projects a magical aura known as the Vigor Mortis. This confers regeneration on the corpse cart and raises the melee attack of nearby undead units. With the Balefire upgrade, the Corpse Cart confers an increased chance to miscast on nearby enemy wizards. With the Unholy Lodestone upgrade, the Corpse Cart confers an area-effect regeneration augment on nearby friendly undead units. Mortis Engine The remains of Necromancers and Liche Lords are sometimes enshrined within a Mortis Engine, a cage of fused bone surrounded by trappings of grandeur, and borne to war by a host of spirits bound to the infernal device. Heavy with evil magics and painstakingly illuminated, the Blasphemous Tome the Mortis Engine bears has been crafted with such care that their creator's souls have passed into the leaves of human skin that form its pages. These books can be a boon to the twisted practitioners of necromancy. As a magical support chariot, the Mortis Engine Regenerates hitpoints for itself and nearby friendly undead units, and causes magical damage to nearby enemy units within the same radius. The attendant Blasphemous Tome also increases the owner’s Winds of Magic power reserve. Upon destruction, the Mortis Engine explodes in a cataclysm of arcane energy, causing widespread damage to nearby friends and foes. Free Company Militia While state troops form the mainstay of the Empire’s military forces, its armies are often bulked out by ad-hoc regiments of militia who are recruited to fight as and when required. No one can foretell how many will turn up at the muster, or what their fighting quality will be. After all, these irregular troops receive no formal training or discipline. Free Company Militia are dual-role hybrid troops. Armed with both short-range pistols and swords, the can fight as the situation demands. With the Vanguard Deployment ability, they can be deployed deep in the field. Flagellants When battle is joined, bands of crazed Flagellants beat themselves into a frenzy before charging headlong towards the enemy. They throw themselves into the fray without hesitation, against the most hopeless of odds. With howls of doom on their lips and visions of martyrdom in their thoughts, Flagellants fight with wild ferocity, swinging their flails at their enemies and leaving trails of blood and woe in their wake. Flagellants are both Frenzied and Unbreakable. Their Strength of the Penitent special ability super-charges their fighting skills, conferring enhanced physical resistance and melee defence. Knights of The Blazing Sun The Templar order of The Blazing Sun pride themselves on learning the very arts and sciences of war. Resplendent on their armoured mounts, they fight in the name of Myrmidia, the very goddess of warfare. For generations they have fought devoutly for the honour and sanctity of the Empire. Powerful shock cavalry akin to the famous Reiksguard, the Knights of The Blazing Sun carry glinting shields which blind those wishing to cause them harm. This confers a certain resistance to magical damage. Their righteous zeal also grants them flaming attacks. Regiments of Renown These are elite units – legendary within the annals of the Old World – whose statistics are much-improved over those of their standard counterparts. They can be unlocked for recruitment when the Lord under your command has attained the sufficient skill level, and are instantly recruited from the special Regiments of Renown recruitment menu into his army. In this respect they differ from standard units, which spend at least one turn in the recruitment queue. Alongside enhanced stats, each Regiment of Renown also has one or more special abilities its standard-roster counterpart does not. Please note: unit abilities and details subject to change. Empire The Tattersouls - Flagellants Increased unit size This brotherhood of zealots is led by the crazed prophet Gerhard The Worm, who fought alongside Volkmar in the war against The Everchosen. Little remains of his personality now but the raw fervour which drives his men. Stirland’s Revenge – Free Company Militia Stalk, armour piercing missiles, immune to psychology A shower of growling ne’er-do-wells, the ragged militia of Stirland’s Revenge are always spoiling for a fight. What they lack in personal hygiene, they more than make up for in their thirst for vengeance against the undead. Hammer of The Witches – Great Cannon Enhanced physical resistance, shells cause magical damage A single regiment is all that remains of Fort Oberstyre’s once-formidable batteries. The Hammer of The Witches earned its name in service of the town of Gortansford, tearing The Grey Hag to shreds with hastily-improvised grapeshot-rounds of horseshoes. Sigmar’s Sons - Swordsmen Unbreakable Sigmar’s Sons originally served in The Red Masquers, a regiment that fought alongside Volkmar against the Norscans. They are Veteran warriors and merciless killers to a man, fearless in the face of evil.  Silver Bullets – Handgunners Stalk, bullets deal magical damage Prior to battle, their foul-mouthed quartermaster Curser Brecht hands each of these marksmen a single silver bullet, granting them proof against whatever Sylvania may throw against them. Whether real or imagined, these good-luck charms seem to work… The Sunmaker – Helstorm Rocket Battery Flaming attacks, Increased number of missiles per volley The final invention of the scatterbrained Talabheim alchemist Jurgen Bugelstrauss before his untimely demise, The Sunmaker fires specialist phosphoric rockets that burn with a blinding brilliance. The Templehof Luminark – Luminark of Hysh Encourage, Net of Amyntok Crafted by Jovi Sunscryer, most experienced of the White Wizards, The lenses of the Templehof Luminark are ground to perfection and offer an unmatched degree of focus. The Royal Altdorf Gryphites – Demigryphs Cause terror At the head of the Drakwald Riders, the Royal Altdorf Gryphites are among the finest of The Order’s inner-circle of cavalrymen. Zintler’s Reiksguard – Reiksguard Vanguard Deployment Led by the Reiksmarshal Hans Zintler, the long and oft-storied history of this proud order has given them a peerless positional perspective. Masters of the flanking manoeuvre, their enemies find themselves under savage assault before the battle has been joined in earnest. Vampire Counts The Feasters in The Dusk – Crypt Ghouls Stalk, vanguard deployment Most Crypt Ghouls are only too eager to pound towards their foes for the meal they represent. The Feasters in The Dusk are uncharacteristically measured in their approach, preferring to advance in stealthy fashion before lunging at their prey from the shadows. The Devils of Shwartzhafen – Vargheists Vanguard Deployment These once-handsome sons of the Von Carstein dynasty, trapped for long years in the warpstone-tainted caverns below Castle Swartzhafen, bear no trace of their former intellect. Now, they haunt the night at Mannfred’s behest, tearing his opponents to bloody rags. The Direpack – Dire Wolves Bonus VS large, increased mass and size Uncommonly ferocious, these grossly muscled fiends eschew smaller targets in favour of foes large enough to satisfy their ravenous appetites. The Sternsmen – Grave Guard Regeneration In life, these cursed warriors were the honour guard of Verek The Blade, First Castellan of Sternieste. In death, they fight with an unholy zeal which resists the blows of their foes. The Tithe – Zombies Increased size and physical resistance These once-proud fighting men of Sylvania, now reduced to shambling servants of The Midnight Aristocracy, are physically superior to ‘civilian’ zombies in every way  The Chillgheists – Hexwraiths Magical Resistance, slowing aura Guardians of the Necropolis of Vargravia, The Chillgheists draw power from the cursed land and instil a blasphemous resolve in their cold-hearted brethren. The Claw of Nagash – Mortis Engine Magical Resistance, slowing aura It is said that the huge ironbone reliquary of this Mortis Engine contains the withered but still-moving hand of Nagash himself, lending it the unholy power to ward off enemy magics.  Verek’s Reavers – Black Knights Regeneration Cursed to fight for the Wight King Verek The Blade, these cavalry are seemingly unstoppable, their limbs reattaching and shattered bones remade before their opponents’ startled eyes. The Konigstein Stalkers – Skeleton Warriors Poison Attacks, improved armour Even veterans of conflict with the clacking hordes of Sylvania are unprepared for the poisonous onslaught of the Konigstein Stalkers. \",\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game The Fortunate Isles are in trouble! The sinister Lord Urizen is using the economic crisis to impose his cruel policies on the people, and all the local politicians seem to be in his thrall. Meanwhile, the ancient biotechnological dwelling known as Underhome is facing foreclosure, and its inhabitants don't even know why. Desperate for help, The Mysterious-Druid, scion of the Mysterious-Druid family and caretaker of Underhome, creates a magical portal that will allow you to interact directly with the Lands of Dream. Are you ready for a journey? The Portal The portal is easy to use - it functions much like a classic point & click adventure game. You can move around the world using specially-grown directional arrows, store objects in your surprisingly capacious inventory, talk to the inhabitants of the Fortunate Isles using a technodruidic Wall of Text biointerface, and spend most of your time examining mushrooms. The Steam Version Time in the Lands of Dream flows at a different pace, so it doesn't really matter that this portal was initially released in 2012. It has since been updated with a number of oft-requested features and improvements, as well as a number of strange additions and changes no-one asked for, but which have appeared anyway. Technodruidism is frequently unpredictable. Feature List Explore the Fortunate Isles! Talk to interesting people and creatures! A mouse in your inventory! Walls of text! Thousands upon thousands of details to find! An awesome alchemy system that's totally not confusing! Contains achievements! Includes “The Road to Underhome” PDF! No need to be into adventure games to enjoy this! But it's cool if you are! Literary, thoughtful, philosophical! Quirky, interesting, different!! Something, something, something! Adjectives! Words! SEO-optimized flatulence! You know what? Feature lists suck! Better just read a few of the reviews! Or try another portal to the Lands of Dream! Most of them are free! If I see any more exclamation marks, I’ll get a headache! Credits The portal was created by The Mysterious-Druid with the help of Jonas Kyratzes ( The Talos Principle , Serious Sam 4 , The Infinite Ocean ), Verena Kyratzes ( Serious Sam 4 , Zombies and Elephants , the Lands of Dream series), and Chris Christodoulou ( Risk of Rain , Deadbolt ).\",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content  Route includes 4 Sessions. \"The Canadian Pacific Railway Mountain Sub itself ( Rogers Pass being a separate subsection ) stretches over 300 km East-West. Starting at Ottertail just SE of Field. This takes more than 10+ hours non-stop driving obeying rules and signals and negotiating grades and the trip ends East of Three Valley Lake! This part of the CPR posed tremendous engineering challenges to the 19th-century builders. Standing out are the passages through the Kicking Horse Canyon ( see Kicking Horse Canyon Trainz route ) and across the Rogers Pass. The descent from Kicking Horse Pass towards the Columbia River at Golden meant that the railway had to be hacked and blasted out of the sheer cliffs of the canyon of the Kicking Horse River. Passage of the Selkirk Mountains across Rogers Pass was an even greater challenge and the original route carried the railway through the pass, not beneath it through tunnels. Rogers Pass is one of those subsections that will submerge you in sheer beauty and awe regarding landscape and railways - the Rocky Mountains at its majestic best! Our route stretches 33km from South Portal to MacDonald Tunnel East, emerging 12km later, then continuing on 63km to Revelstoke. Take a side tour there to investigate the Powder Hill Ski Gondola (past the Airport) or the Revelstoke Canyon Dam (5km to the North). After crossing the Columbia River the mainline continues roughly parallel to the Trans Canada Highway 15km further to South West portal. Driving long haul consists over the mountain passes and famous tunnels like McDonald and Connaught will take all your attention to make it a safe and enjoable trip. Imagine the railway climbing even higher from Stoney Creek siding onwards, then following the narrow canyon where now the Trans-Canada Highway runs with its extensive snow sheds. On the western side of the pass the railway descended with loops through side-valleys, only to rejoin the current tracks just west of Glacier siding. History of the Rogers Pass Tunnels: The high cost of pusher engines and snow clearing made tunnelling inevitable, resulting at first in the Connaught Tunnel. The capacity of the single-track railway had grown insufficient by the 1970s, at which time then-prime minister Pierre Trudeau was heard to remark: Well, why don\\'t they double-track it then? Why not indeed, and so over the next 20 years the MacDonald Tunnel and its eastern approaches were built, which increased the capacity of the railway from about 12 to 18 trains per day in each direction. That is not counting stoppages due to snow and rock slides. Those sizable yards at Revelstoke, Ross Peak and, especially, Golden (see Columbia River Basin subsection and or Kicking Horse Canyon subsection) are indicative of the need for waiting tracks while snow and debris is being cleared. With this route, a number of superb related sessions created by Hkoster1 highlight the capacity of the railway under ideal conditions, using either one or both of the tunnels. These sessions come both in automatic and dispatcher options.',\n",

We are little more than a few scattered people living in caves and under bushes, banging rocks together to keep warm and eat berries. Your challenge is to bring humanity together. Lift us up out of the stone age and forge ahead, all the while worrying about what destroyed mankind last time and if it will return to finish the job. Evolution of Ages is a game of managing resources and crafting output over a limited space. You control the pace of the game, relax for many days of playing as you customize each character and train their skills in the items of the era, or rush ahead researching technology as fast as you can. The choice is yours. Features Character Customisation - Change name, appreance & voices, obtain a large range of feats and even allocate them to a family. 10 Technological Eras - From the Stone age to the Space Age. You control the pace of advancement through research and seeking out more land to settle. Play at a speed you are most comfortable with and stay in an era as long as you wish. 100+ Buildings to place and use from housing to factories. With space being your primary issue for much of the game, deciding on what to build is key to success. 60+ Character Skills. Each character can only train in 15 skills at any one time, so you will need to develop specialists and keep them alive. 10+ World Skills. Ranging from house design and metal lore to militia combat training, these skills will effect all your settlements. Diplomacy Points. Although you cannot fit everyone into your settlements, the people who live in the wild are still important to your success. Help them and gain diplomacy points that can be spent on benefits later. 1000+ Items, books and recipes: The game has in-depth crafting at its core. Your characters will need to gain skills in various crafting methods to unlock the ability to craft rare and more powerful items as well as advance in technological eras. 100+ Base Monsters 9 Boss fights, each with their own unique treasure. (Including some with difficulty levels, ultra rare drops and rare spawns) Scout the world for information on the Blight and help out the struggling remains of mankind. 5 Difficulty Settings World and Settlement Threat - leading to the Doomsday system and Main Plot Failure! Be careful not to take on challenges that are beyond your character's skills. Too many failures will increase doomsday points and lead to Victory for the Blight.

Regain your kingdom making hell tremble under your hooves! Left no one alive if they won't bend the knee. SURVIVE THE DOWNFALL You are the Succubus – a wild and lustful demon who rejected the role of the queen of the infernal abyss. \\xadWith the disappearance of the legitimate rulers of Hell, the remaining demons recognized Nimrod as their ruler, because he was the only soul who could dominate the mind of the mighty Beast. By raising his new empire from the corpses of sinners, the new king, along with his new queen – you – managed to control the chaos left by former rulers. The life of luxury and walking on rugs sewn from the skins of martyrs was not for you though, and so you have chosen a life in the wilderness. By satisfying your appetites and original instincts, you inflict pain by hurting everyone and everything in your path. The moment you meet the powerful Baphomet who, together with his army, is going to get the soul of Nimrod, you are captured and maimed. Betrayed by your own species you are left with only one goal that matters –  revenge! DOMINATE HELL You are the greatest terror in this brutal world. Teach your opponents that standing in your way is the biggest mistake they could make. Become the judge and the executioner and unleash your rage both on the damned souls and the demons that will challenge you. Climb the steep rocks, swim in the blood full of snakes and avoid the traps of this living, pulsating hell. Inflict suffering, mutilate, murder and free your wrath to regain your rightful rule of the hellish dominion! UNWIND YOUR SKILLS Gain experience by killing other beings and then use it to upgrade your basic skills and unlock additional, more powerful and brutal ones. Eat your opponents' hearts and let the rage come over you and release your pirokinesis skills! RIP AND TEAR! Use your weapons and unique armor to deal with your opponents. Attack enemies with your claws or wield the bone swords, clubs and other weapons you pick from dead enemies! Massacre your enemies, leaving behind the ocean of cut limbs and charred corpses.

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game *NEWS* - The new Aircraft Carrier Landing Competition Mode is now available Note: The pre-release is Oculus only.  The full release will support both Oculus and Vive. We've opened up a thread in the discussion area for questions and feedback.  We'll monitor this 24/7 throughout the pre-release. We're aware the pre-release has a few bugs and issues.  As such, we've discounted the price to $19.99. The game will be updated regularly every Friday until the Full Release. We're dedicated to creating the best VR experience possible and your feedback is important. Think of this as your own VR title, where your ideas and thoughts will be implemented into the game. Flying Aces - Navy Pilot Simulator is a story based virtual reality (Oculus and HTC Vive) experience unlike any other. You will experience what it’s like to train to become a navy pilot. As gamers, we search for experiences that aren’t possible in our daily lives. With Navy Pilot Simulator, we’re able to bring the armchair pilot into the cockpit of a fighter jet. We have long wanted to develop a true pilot simulator, but this wasn’t possible until the advent of virtual reality. The Oculus Rift allows us to offer an experience that previous generations of hardware aren’t capable of. Our goal is to create a true to life experience as opposed to a game. The Game  Flying Aces - Navy Pilot Simulator is a story driven pilot experience. Conquering the game will require a skillset of hand eye coordination, decision making, and a tough stomach. You start out as a low ranked Ensign (below a junior lieutenant) tasked with learning the functionality of the F-18 Super Hornet. As you progress through the ranks, the missions become more challenging. The experience takes you through basic take off missions, missile target practice, harrowing carrier landings in storm conditions, and beyond. Features  Full Touch Controls True to life graphics Ultra detailed aircraft models and cockpit Ultra detailed Aircraft Carrier Model Realistic Physics Engine Varied Weather Story Based Gameplay and Missions Aircraft Destruction Voluminous Clouds Landing Grading System The Team The team consists of a handful of top developers and two business partners who wish they studied game development in College. We thank you for your support and help in creating our pilot experience. Your input, feedback, and contributions are crucial to the success of Navy Pilot Simulator.\",\n",

As tensions are coming to a boil, Dinyon the most powerful of the new demigods, is assassinated while at prayer.  His allies quickly catch and kill his assassin, but with his dying breath, the assassin fingers you as the mage responsible for the assassination plot.

To beat the game the player needs to plow through every weakness of their personality - represented in the game as different bosses in their respective worlds - to finally take on the ultimate challenge. In Your Realm is in part a homage to classic titles such as Golden Axe, Mega Man and Zelda: A link to the past, where focus lies on challenging and fun gameplay with good replayability. Each of every one of the hundred of unique monsters in the game offers their own set of attacks and behaviors. Every decent run grants the player rewards to spend to introduce new elements and buffs in the next run. Altogether this makes every play a different experience. Features: 100 unique monsters. Skill tree that evolves based on: spells found, skills aquired, attributes leveled, bosses killed and your playstyle. Armors and weapons, displayed on the character. Randomized labyrinth of rooms and encounters/rewards in them. Characteristics gained by playing in a certain manner. These give specific bonuses/penalties in alignment with that playstyle. Extra lives when progressing beyond the first boss (in easy and normal difficulties). Activatable rewards after each decent run. Diplomas recording your best stats for each difficulty, such as: rooms explored, monsters killed, block% etc. Monsters fight back! (not mainly hack-n-slash or shoot-n-dodge gameplay) ',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game  GAME DESCRIPTION Rehtona tells the story of a girl trapped between two contrasting worlds: the ordinary world, and the World Behind the Gate. After suddenly finding herself alone in the World Behind the Gate, Rehtona collects “memory fragments” (scattered throughout this world) in order to find out what happened – but whenever a complete image is assembled, a memory that doesn't seem to belong to Rehtona becomes imprinted onto her mind ... Each level features a complete sequence of puzzles derived from the interactions between the two worlds. Players act in one world, and anticipate how it will impact the other world in order to overcome puzzles and find memory fragments. As she painstakingly collects each missing piece by bouncing between two distinct dimensions, Rehtona’s ultimate quest for the truth may be more than she bargained for – a shocking revelation about herself … and even reality itself. BACKSTORY It was just an ordinary day…. As Rehtona chats with friends in the town square, the world as she knows it began to change without warning – and another world appeared to overlap with reality. Suddenly, Rehtona finds herself alone in the town square – and an unfamiliar door appears before her eyes. A weak voice could be heard behind the door … calling her name. Rehtona musters up the courage to open the door, but she could see nothing but an isolated world beyond it. Then her own world begins to shatter as she falls into unconsciousness. When she awakes, she realizes that she is still in her own world – but that world has now become empty and isolated … similar to what she saw on the other side of the door. She finds a photo in a picture frame lying in front of her house containing a simple yet mysterious message: “Find yourself...” This marks the beginning of Rehtona’s journey – one you will not soon forget. Key Features · Explore two unique yet interconnected world. · Face 32 levels filled with clever puzzles based on cause-and-effect mechanics. · Experience a deep storyline that deals with identity, memory, and the true nature of self. · Enjoy stunning, handcrafted pixel art graphics inspired by traditional 16- and 32-bit platformers. · Uncover the truth with multiple endings and Easter Eggs. \",\n",

Well, Wiseghaika surely hopes that somebody will do something. Some fairies managed to learn how to use them as a weapon, so fights will be less painful. But not all of them have mastered this art. To be exact - neither of our six heroes can use those mysterious stones in big barrages. This... might give you some problems. But c\\'mon, since when were heroes stronger that their foes? (Please, don\\'t say it in front of Skootis.) Back to gems! Weird thing about them - when two of the same color collide, they go \"ding\" and release some weird spheres. Those spheres can absorb other gems! Red spheres, for example, absorb all red gems, they meet, but will stop after absorbing any gem that isn\\'t red. The same happens with others, mostly-maybe! (\\'^\\' ) If gems will touch left side of your screen, you\\'ll get hurt! Does it makes sense? What are \"screens\"? I heard abut them from Astro-fairies, but now they are extinct, so I can\\'t ask them. Gray gems are different and weird! They won\\'t hurt you and most likely will disappear after touching that weird shield in front of you. It is almost like they\\'re devoid of energy. But you shouldn\\'t take them too easy - You can\\'t destroy them as there are no gray gems in your arsenal, so, only way is either to wait while they will be destroyed by the barrier, or make some sphere touch them. =about the Game Itself= This game is made in the vein of old puzzle-like games, without real twist. Just simple active puzzle.Or maybe there is some twist? For the first game made with this engine I think it is good job from my side, considering, that everything except music is made by sole silly me. Now, there is a couple known bugs that can occur, but won\\'t destroy game too much, or maybe they are finally gone - couldn\\'t get them last beta-testing session. Game just... likes to be important to you, so please remember to put it on a pause, if you suddenly need to do something else, while playing. (\\'^\\' ) Please, tell us about bugs, we\\'ll be trying to fix them. Remember to save settings in OPTIONS, or else when you restart the game they\\'ll go back to standard ones.      Markiza Info-fairy - Young individual composed of only two things - information and desire to obtain new information.       Sersh Tech-fairy - Lone wanderer, aimlessly pondering around Fairy Lands. Also he often loses his hand, so it is hidden in his pocket most of time.       Roxanna Rag-fairy - Little silly girl with a big melodic dream. She is soft to the touch too.       Volia Aqua-fairy - Self-confident boy made of magical clay who possesses ability to control water. He is water. He is sane. He loves to eat.       Skootis Ash-fairy - She will be the strongest, you hear me? This is for sure is not her writings! But it is truth!       Rinka Barbarian-fairy - This girl surely loves marzipan cakes. And to crush stuff when cake goes not into her belly. And hey, she is important!

You can wander freely around the game environment, collecting evidence and witnessing constantly changing events.  But the game is all about interviewing the characters you meet, questioning them about all the evidence you’ve collected and things you’ve seen, then spotting contradictions in their answers.  Pair two contradictions together and watch them try to worm out of it!  Works best plugged into a TV preferably with a bunch of people to help spot the lies - but can be played alone on your laptop or PC just fine!',\n",

He was an alchemist researching a cure for his nephew from poison, but he had to travel beyond the Empire to pick up herbs to finalize the cure mix. Little did he know, that he had an omen following him. The loyal servant to the high priest, who had an aggressive debate on science and religion with the alchemist. Taking back evidence, the alchemist shoes with demonic presence known as \"demonic magic prints\" that infest themselves on anybody near a demonic blessed fountain, the alchemist gets accused of allying with the demons or becoming demon himself and is sent to exile. Ignis the Shaper (shaper of fire, a god of fire), erases the alchemists memory and controls his surroundings by putting a helmet on him. In return of doing Ignis the favour of killing the Shaper Hunter, he will cleanse the alchemist of any demonic prints on him and help him on becoming a citizen of the Empire again. Features Tower defense mechanics in an action roleplaying environment. Crafting and Survival. Strategical decisions. Explore, die, repeat and then win. Loot and get stronger. ',\n",

The story is told through newspaper articles, notes left by a disgruntled secretary, unwelcome letters, audio tape recordings and a unique journal that evolves throughout the game based on the player’s own insightful analysis of an unusual therapy session. THE STORY After the mysterious death of Dr. Pokorny, Dr. Novak, relatively unknown by many, takes over the illustrious psychotherapy practice. At the same time he inherits Mrs.Ruzicka, the secretary of the deceased psychologist. In the hands of Dr.Novak, the practice is less then flourishing. One morning, Dr.Novak receives a box of audio tapes – Recorded psychotherapy sessions to be exact – and he is asked to listen to them and give his insightful analysis of its content. Sadly, things take a turn for the worst for Dr.Novak. His troubled mind seems to be getting the best of him...Or does it? You decide. You are this psychotherapist. You are Dr.Novak ...And your task is to carefully analyze and give your insight on the recorded therapy sessions. Ultimately, your answers will determine your own fate, Dr. Novak. FEATURES Fully narrated psychotherapy sessions by Joseph K. Krachtovil himself. Three different endings based on the player’s insight. Interactive desktop with controllable timespans making days shorter or longer. Immersive storyline delivered to the player via letters, notes, journal entries and audio recording.

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game Cosmic Horror and Sci-Fi are two ways to talk about Dolmen. It is a third person action game with RPG elements but with a lovecraftian plot that calls players to find what’s behind the darkest secret of the universe! A forgotten planet called Revion Prime will be the place where the action takes part. And it won’t be easy: Adaptation and exploration will be your main weapons as you craft new items and equipments from your enemies’ carcasses! Every step can be your last one! Use your experience points to improve yourself and face what no human has ever faced. After all, quoting David Hume: “The life of man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster.” Maybe he was right… Or not. GAMEPLAY & FEATURES STRATEGIC AND DINAMIC COMBAT What’s left to someone put in such a situation? Well, if you’ll have to face the unpredictable, you’ll have to improvise! Intense Melee Combat Experience rich combat with various types of melee weapons and moves! Attack, block and dodge, as you try to escape from the enemies as well as damage them. Smart Ranged Combat Use ranged weapon's elemental shots to cause different debuffs on enemies! All creatures answer specifically to each combination, making the battles always innovative and demanding, so you have to be always attentive! Energy Management To activate your ranged weapons, some energy must be spent. But this isn’t the only use of Energy. By activating “Energy Mode”, your melee weapon will be empowered too! Also, you can use a portion of Energy to recover a small portion of your HP quickly. But beware, energy does not regenerate by itself, so use it carefully! Challenging Enemies Surviving is the last thing the cosmos wants you to do... Along your way, many creatures will try to end your journey to continue their own! Gruesome Bosses The human race deserves to subsist? Many alpha predators will say no! EXPLORATION All environment will provide a feeling of being apart from Earth, which means that a whole new kind of views are waiting for you. Fungi, corpses and amorphous stalactites compound the way. Different kinds of vegetal life infest the ecosystem of Revion Prime. Every level shows different ways to understand the place: Its plants, fog and terrain will be constantly changing and more and more daring… A whole world can be yours. But you’ll never be yourself again… PLOT Learn the language of the universe as you struggle to stay alive! The plot may be comprehended as an investigation focusing the past and future of an alien planet as seen through the eyes of a human being. Although his original task was very different from that, he was brought to a reality never seen before, with no resources and unprepared for what he will find there. Uncover the truth by finding and connecting each piece of the lost alphabet of this galaxy! SURVIVAL Behold this unforgiving planet called Revion Prime, the last maze to reach the Dolmen! CRAFT Craft equipments (weapons and armor) and upgrade them to become part of an alien society or what’s left of it… You must scour this alien planet, harvest Materials, from dead bodies and create the ultimate survivor gear! Look for the answer or make your own! LEVEL UP Your character has an array of attributes that can be leveled up by using XP, gained from defeating the strangest life forms! You can level up your character however you want to suit your specific play style.\",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content The Marder 2 was an experimental German IFV, developed in the late 1980s to replace the aging Marder IFV. It featured more armor, a new turret and a brand-new Rheinmetall dual-caliber autocannon that could fire both 35mm and 50mm rounds. Despite its qualities, the vehicle was never accepted in service due to its high cost and because it was no longer needed because of the fall of the Soviet Union. A single surviving prototype can be found today in the Koblenz military collection. In Armored Warfare, the Marder 2 is a Tier 8 Armored Fighting Vehicle. With its 44 tons, it’s one of the heaviest and toughest AFVs around. Unlike many other AFVs of its Tier, it is not armed with guided missiles, relying instead on its extremely powerful 50mm autocannon. It also features special black camouflage.',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content  D&D Tomb of Annihilation Dare to defy death in this adventure for the world’s greatest roleplaying game. The talk of the streets and taverns has all been about the so-called death curse: a wasting disease afflicting everyone who’s ever been raised from the dead. Victims grow thinner and weaker each day, slowly but steadily sliding toward the death they once denied. When they finally succumb, they can’t be raised—and neither can anyone else, regardless of whether they’ve ever received that miracle in the past. Temples and scholars of divine magic are at a loss to explain a curse that has affected the entire region, and possibly the entire world. The cause is a necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger, which is located somewhere in Chult, a mysterious peninsula far to the south, ringed with mountains and choked with rainforests. D&D Tomb of Annihilation includes the following: 56 battle maps with pre-placed grids and encounters 37 pieces of artwork that are sharable with players Over 600 story pages full of adventure and links to treasure, encounters, NPCs, roll tables, quests, and sharable images. A beautifully designed reference manual with embedded images and sidebars. 2 new backgrounds, 24 quests, over 400 NPCs and monsters, over 20 devious traps, and many new items unique to Chult. Adventure design by  Christopher Perkins, Will Doyle, and Steve Winter , with additional design by  Adam Lee . Story consulting by the award-winning creator of Adventure Time , Pendleton Ward . Released on September 08, 2017. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 3.2.2 and higher. Requirements: An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the built-in 5E Ruleset. Recommended: D&D Basic Rules, D&D Complete Core Class Pack or D&D Character Customization Pack',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content  Weird Wars Rome: Nox Germanica The dark, dripping forests of Germania have long been a source of mystery and fear for Rome. These trackless lands and their barbaric inhabitants present an environment unlike anything else in the Known World. From the time of Julius Caesar, Germania has resisted the best efforts of Rome to bring the light of civilization to its benighted lands. Our legionaries now find themselves on the Limes Germanicus, a system of walls, ditches, and watch towers designed to keep watch over the angry, gathering barbarians. But are the Germans simply resisting Roman rule? Or is there something more sinister lurking the dark forests beyond? Nox Germanica is a full-length adventure for Weird Wars Rome. Besides a tale of adventure, horror, and mystery in Germanica, it also includes designs for a Roman castrum. For use with Weird Wars Rome. Fantasy Grounds Conversion: Matt Rimler Released on May 05, 2017. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 3.2.2 and higher. Requires: An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds ruleset.',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content The Class 158 Express Sprinter is a familiar site to people across Britain, and this classic DMU (diesel multiple unit) is ideal for running passenger services on your UK routes in Train Simulator.   The Class 158 was introduced by British Rail in 1989 as part of the programme to replace ageing heritage DMUs still in service. With an aluminium body, the Class 158 was dubbed the Express Sprinter as it was designed to accelerate rapidly between stations, making it ideal for stopping services where new tighter timetables could now be introduced. With a top speed of 90mph and comfortable interior furnishings, it was also intended to be capable of handling longer services with ease.   The Class 158 for Train Simulator includes three liveries, allowing you to recreate services from different parts of Britain.',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content Our Hornet is the culmination of more than 40 man years of intense research, technology development, art creation, and ground-breaking coding. The Hornet brings the first, true, multi-role fighter to the skies of DCS World with equally impressive air-to-surface and air-to-air capabilities. DCS: F/A-18C Hornet is initially being released as an Open Beta, with several features to be added during the Open Beta period. This includes several sensors, weapons, and sub-systems. About the DCS: F/A-18C Hornet The F/A-18C Hornet is twin engine, supersonic fighter that is flown by a single pilot in a “glass cockpit”. It combines extreme maneuverability , a deadly arsenal of weapons, and the ability to operate from an aircraft carrier. Operated by several nations, this multi-role fighter has been instrumental in conflicts from 1986 to today. The Hornet is equipped with a large suite of sensors that includes a radar, targeting pod, and a helmet mounted sight. In addition to its internal 20mm cannon, the Hornet can be armed with a large assortment of unguided bombs and rockets, laser and GPS-guided bombs, air-to-surface missiles of all sorts, and both radar and infrared-guided air-to-air missiles. This results in amazing gameplay potential with this single aircraft. The Hornet is also known for its extreme, slow-speed maneuverability in a dogfight. We have gone to great lengths to model the flight aerodynamics and fly-by-wire flight control system of the Hornet to allow you to experience the real feeling of power and extreme capabilities this aircraft has to offer. Although incredibly deadly, the Hornet is also a very easy aircraft to fly. Being an aircraft carrier capable aircraft, our Hornet also comes with the most detailed aircraft carrier ever created for a PC game. Catapult from the “boat”, strike a large assortment of targets that only DCS World can offer, then “call the ball” and land on the carrier. DCS: F/A-18C Hornet in DCS World provides the most rich and authentic digital combat aviation you will ever experience! Key Features of DCS: F/A-18C Hornet: Professional Flight Model (PFM) and authentic Flight Control System (FCS). Experience the thrill of flying this supersonic warbird. Includes a new, highly-detailed USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier with fully operational steam catapults, arrestor wires, “meat ball” landing system, TACAN navigation, jet blast deflectors, radar antennas, defense systems, and lights. The most realistic model of the F/A-18C imaginable, down to each bolt and flake of paint, animated controls surfaces, lights, damage model, and landing gear. Detailed simulation of the Hornet’s many sub-systems like engines, fuel, electrical, hydraulic, radios, lighting, emergency, and many, many more. Although features like “auto start” are available, the sense of accomplishment cannot be overstated after learning to operate this state-of-the-art machine. Inertia and GPS navigation systems with moving map display allow you multiple ways to find your target and get you back to “mother”. Dozens of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons and sensors. From simple rockets to high-tech GPS and laser-guided bombs, experience what only Hornet pilots have experienced ‘til now. A highly realistic and exhaustively researched cockpit that is mouse interactive with 6 degrees of freedom. Interact with the cockpit by pressing buttons and moving switches. You will feel like part of the aircraft with our Advanced Systems Modeling (ASM) . Authentic Hornet sounds provided with the assistance of Boeing, the Hornet’s manufacturer. New effects have been developed for our Hornet like leading edge extension vapor, over-wing vapor, rain on canopy, and new explosions. Virtual Reality support. Take advantage of the latest VR technologies to immerse yourself in the simulation. Other than the G’s, you will feel like you are there! Multiple liveries for the US Navy, US Marine Corps, Canada, Australia, Spain, Switzerland, Finland, and many more. Open Beta Release This is an Open Beta release and the following items will be added during the Open Beta development period: Sensors: A/A radar with TWS, SCAN RAID, AZ/EL A/G radar with MAP, EXP1, EXP2, EXP3, SEA, GMT, PVU, AGR, IRA, and TA AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR Targeting Pod Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) Link-16 AWW-13 Datalink Pod NVGs Weapons: AGM-88C HARM AGM-45A/B Shrike AGM-84D Block 1C Harpoon AGM-84E SLAM AGM-84H/K SLAM-ER AGM-65E/F/G Maverick AGM-154A/C JSOW Walleye I/II ER/DL GBU-10/12/16/24B Paveway II GBU-38/31/32 JDAM AIM-9X Sidewinder AIM-7P Sparrow AIM-120B/C AMRAAM Mk-40 Destructor Sea Mine Mk-63 Quickstrike Sea Mine Mk-77 Fire Bomb Decoys: ADM-141 TALD GEN-X',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Content  Meanders Map Pack: Shard Roads This pack contains 29 Ice-Themed Meanders Maps sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play. Meanders maps are somewhat special by having a built-in repeating entrance/exit point so that no matter whether you put another map on the left, right, above or below or flip it top to bottom, either itself or a different Meander Map - the pathways will line up allowing continuous sprawling landscapes and terrains for your adventurers to explore. They are sized to perfectly fit a 50px or 60px grid that you can manually place over the top of the map using Fantasy Grounds. This pack is an expansion set used on its own or in conjunction with Venmire Woods or other GTW Meander Map Packs. Meanders maps are highly-detailed and feature themed maps for a huge range of encounters. Shard Roadsincludes numerous icy roads with bends, straights, crossroads and T-junctions, dead ends with caves, icy ravines with or without bridges, frozen lakes, rivers and crystal chasm, various cavern entrances, a forest cemetery, an ice temple, a glacier and ice floes leading to the sea, assorted joins to forest or road, two blenders that transition from snow to jungle or snow to desert, a range of flipped versions of some of the maps to help bend roads, end roads, end terrain, or make new map variants from mirror joins. It also includes a few maps that are completely exclusive to this pack - and - a special blizzard tile for total white outs. This set also contains a Map Selection Panel: a convenient visual display of all the maps pinned with a link (shown as a red pin) that you can simply click to bring up. Join the maps together or encounter them one by one - it's up to you. Users can opt to load/lay the maps manually and build a custom layout - or use a combination of Time-lapse, Role-play and/or the supplied Random Roll Tables to determine when maps are used and where adventurers end up next.The 2 Random Roll Tables (one for all maps and one for Roads Only) are weighted so that some environments are more likely to be rolled than others including a slim chance of a blizzard. Converted by: Kris Mc Dermott Released on July 20, 2018. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 3.3.5 and higher. Requires: An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and any ruleset.\",\n",

Here, helicopters are important for traffic in areas that buses and ferries do not reach, while visitors from abroad arrive at Vágar Airport. The scenery Faroe Islands XP now recreates the entire archipelago for XPlane 11 – Maps2XPlane have developed the terrain mesh of Faroes4XPlane, while Albert Ràfols has contributed the airport Vágar and the helipads. Thanks to seasonal adaptations the high-resolution terrain mesh always perfectly fits the current time of year, while the autogen has been realised in a uniquely Faroese style by both designers. In addition, there are hundreds of custom objects, 3D vegetation, and night lighting. Virtual pilots can approach Vágar Airport (FAE, EKVG) that mirrors its real-world counterpart to great detail – like the runway that is realistically sloped. The eight helipads spread over the islands are included in this scenery as well. Realistic recreation of the complete Faroe Islands with an area of about 1.400 km² High resolution terrain mesh with various texture sets for a seasonal representation Customized local terrain details, e.g. realistically sloped runway at the Vágar Airport Detailed rendition of the Vágar Airport and the eight helipads spread over the archipelago Faroese themed autogen, navigation obstacles and dynamic traffic on the islands Hundreds of custom objects with PBR materials, 3D vegetation, night lighting ',\n",

So when the clouds roll in and the rain starts to fall you know something is on the way. Rumours are that a group of citizens have united to form a mysterious cult and have placed a curse over Tropico. A new supernatural authority is looking to seize power and you, as El Presidente, need some divine assistance to lift the curse. Enter, the Inquisition. Bring the special services provided by the Inquisition to Tropico and keep them in good favour by building them a new HQ from which to bring down the cultists and their supernatural wrongdoings. But don’t let them have too much power. Make sure you remind them that only you, El Presidente, is the one true ruler of Tropico. Only through your careful management can you guarantee that Tropico returns to the island paradise it was before. New standalone scenario: “Tropican Redemption“ – Banish the cultists from your island and lift Tropico from its curse New building: Inquisition – Spy on factions and unmask the roles of each faction member New dynasty avatar accessory: Inquisitor’s hat New sandbox map: Isla del Rey New music track and additional voice recordings ',\n",

It features a tile-built, turn-based game world where the result of absolutely every action is rolled, calculated or statistically determined. Hundreds of items and dozens of creatures await your discovery in this classically inspired RPG.  A tile-built, turn-based game world where the result of absolutely every action is rolled, calculated or statistically determined. Strategy is paramount to success; careful skill management, equipment selection and magic usage will win your fights, not rapid button clicking. We are very pleased to say this is not another \"action RPG\".  Hundreds of items and dozens of creatures await your discovery. A combination of randomly generated treasure and carefully hidden goodies means that no two games will play the exact same way.  Unlimited character development style: Choose from 24 unique skills to make the character you want and 8 base attributes that affect your character\\'s every action throughout the game. The game world does not scale or adjust itself to match anyone\\'s play style, so the ease or difficulty of the game is directly related to how successful you are at developing your character.  Combat plays out at your pace. Eschalon: Book I features a turn-based system that allows you to roll through combat as fast or slow you want...make it fast and furious, or analyze every option for maximum advantage.  A non-linear storyline means that the game world is open to explore as you desire. Follow the storyline or don\\'t...it\\'s up to you. Just be careful where you go and who you choose to trust- the world of Eschalon can be a deadly place for an inexperienced adventurer.  An epic adventure that you must face alone...a single-player RPG carefully designed to feel like the great old school RPGs of the past such as Ultima®, Might & Magic®, and Wizardry® ',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game  Worms™: Ultimate Mayhem is the definitive 3D \"Worms™\" game! Load your weapons and experience a whole new dimension in destructive turn-based cartoon action! Taking the game into 3D creates all-new strategic and gameplay possibilities. With over 70 single-player missions and challenges, online and local multi-player for up to 4 players, 5 multi-player modes, Steam Achievements, unprecedented customization of both worms and weapons, and fully destructible environments, it’s bursting with anarchic mayhem. Battle and puzzle your way through all of the missions from both \"Worms™ 3D\" and \"Worms™ 4: Mayhem\" - it’s essentially two games in one. With the addition of HD visuals, gameplay enhancements and new extra content, it is the ultimate 3D \"Worms™\" collection!  Key Features  EXTENSIVE SINGLE-PLAYER CONTENT:  A vast array of single-player content spanning the very best of the 3D \"Worms™\" games, ranging from shooting challenges to speed runs, whilst a collection of crazy missions, interspersed with newly fully voiced narrative FMV sequences, make up the single-player campaign. Additionally, a huge number of challenges ask the player to master the individual skills of the game (such as piloting a Jetpack or steering a Parachute) in order to complete tasks such as target shooting or collecting targets, all against the clock.  ONLINE AND LOCAL MULTI-PLAYER:  Full online play for up to 4 players over a wealth of game modes such as \"Statue Defend\", \"Homelands\" or just plain \"Deathmatch\", plus the ability to create your own custom game settings to play against your friends! Because of the turn-based nature of the game, it can be played multi-player offline on one screen.  Fight on the randomly generated landscapes, even save and share them, which allows for a huge amount of multi-player map options!  GET COMPETITIVE:  Play standard or ranked games in a bid to scale the Steam Leaderboards!  MASSIVE CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:  Players are able to name their teams, choose which hats they want their worms to wear, whether they wear glasses, have moustaches, what they say, which flag represents them, and even what gravestone they leave behind when they die.  Worms™ WEAPONS AND UTILITIES:  Many of the classic Worms™ weapons are present and correct, with the Holy Hand Grenade, Bazooka, Dynamite, Banana Bomb, Baseball Bat, Super Sheep and many more in your arsenal of destruction.  There is also a sprinkling of even more crazy and surreal weapons too, such as Alien Abduction, Fatkins Strike, Flood, Inflatable Scouser, Old Woman, Starburst and Bovine Blitz with which to wage war on your enemies.  CUSTOM BUILT WEAPONRY:  Players are also able to construct their own weapons from a wide selection of components. These weapons are added to the players’ arsenals and remain secret until deployed, giving opponents a nasty shock.  TALK TRASH:  In-game voice-chat so you can cheer on team mates or indeed win the battle against opponents verbally!  FULLY DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENTS:  Deform everything in real-time.  NEW PICTURE-IN-PICTURE DISPLAY:  This tracks every action a player makes when attacking, whilst at the same time allowing the player to retreat and not miss a single moment of the glorious action.  NUMEROUS GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS & ENHANCEMENTS  New camera enhancements make it easier to follow the action; optimized AI means more intelligent enemies, and the addition of speech and lip-synching to the single-player missions makes for even more cinematic fun!  New visual improvements, with dynamic real time lighting and post process effects and shaders, make the mayhem look even more impressive.  ',\n",

Once a humble farmer’s child, you’ve been accepted into Queen Isobel's Rangers: brave knights who patrol the kingdom of Pascalia on scaly beasts. But just as you receive your own dino and begin your career as a knight-ranger, you discover evil forces are converging to destroy the Queen, and Pascalia itself. DinoKnights is a 177,000-word interactive fantasy novel by K.T. Bryski, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Enemies and terrifying foes surround you: but whom should you fear most? The Dread Wizard Sargossa, raising an army of un-dead dragons, or an enemy much closer to the court—the Queen's own sister, Ermessen? And what about your burgeoning talent for magic? Will you hone your powers to save your village and fight Sargossa? With a dinosaur at your side and sword in hand—the realm’s fate rests on you! Play as male, female, or non-binary; gay, straight, or ace. Choose one of six different dinosaurs as your steed, including allosaurus, triceratops, and velociraptor! Foil a palace coup—or join it, instead! Hit the training yard with your dino, or spend your time cozying up to nobles and mages. Find love with the royal heir, a charming bard, or a powerful mage! Discover your secret, magical heritage. Fight to save your own home village from destruction. Defend the poorest peasants, or win fame in Royal Tournaments. Evil is waking, and Pascalia needs you. Will you and your dinosaur answer the call? \",\n",

Actually there are 10 different minigames with 3 difficulty levels each: - Space shooter: You control a space ship and need to survive and destroy the enemies by shooting them. Difficulty increases exponencially due to friendly collision avoidance and prediction of the player's movement. - Lander: Just land on the green platform avoiding hard impacts. Each propulsor is activated with one key (hard to control). - Canon: Shoot to all the objects within the given time. - Helicopter: Reach the end of the tube avoiding sensible hits. - Prevent the red button from going down: And don't get destroyed and destroy the enemy balls. - Memory: Memorize the path and repeat it. - Coloured balls: Match the other ball's color upon collision. - Jump through the hole: That's it. - Jump up: From one orb to another without touching the biohazard yellow material and reach de ceilling. - Shooter: Destroy all the moving objects but don't get too close. You can watch the trailer and see some of them. In the future, I may include some more minigames if the community supports me.\",\n",

For many years the gnomes of Havenwale lived in peace, content to mine their wealth and live off the fruit of their labor. In the space of many years they amassed great hordes of diamonds, mined from beneath their very feet. But this wealth was to be their undoing.  Rumors of their wealth came to the Witch Queen a servant of the banished Horned God. Lying in the poverty of her own filth she lamented to her servants her lack of power and wealth. So she sent Seroneous, an abomination from the pits of Aufstrag, to find and plunder the gnome\\'s holes. \"Burn them out of their rooted homes, suffer them not to live but as slaves to our master, Unklar. Make their homes a slagish heap of pain and death. And bring to me their wealth for I\\'ll have war on the lands of dwarf and man.\"  So Seroneous, a ghastly, misshapen beast himself, went south and plundered the homes of the gnomes. Those he did not kill he gave to the pits and made them mine the wealth for him. But he has found a land entangled with the intrigues of Human Lords, knight errants, adventurers and other folk. The Red Caps are raiding, Kreelkrug the Ogre demands tribute and there is a magic upon the Well of Waters that defies all comers.  Too, the men of the Barren Wood are fierce, independent and distrustful of outsiders. Facing them is a daunting task in the best of times and now they seem to be protecting one of their own. Or are they? Discovering the real powers in this region only brings the characters closer to doom as they travel to piles and heaps of slag and detritus that was once a glorious abode and temple to the dark powers before the age man.  The Barren Wood is a wild place of intrigue, banditry and adventure! The Slag Heap is continues the adventures set out in Assault on Blacktooth Ridge, but can be played independent of that adventure. For 3-5 characters, levels 2-4. The Adventure continues!  This product was one of the earlier adventures for Fantasy Grounds, so it doesn\\'t take advantage of all the latest features, such as map hotlinks to story entries, auto-rolling random tables and pre-defined encounters. You can easily add these additional elements by dragging portions of the story to your map while holding down CTRL, dragging the NPCs to a new encounter or copying the table entries to a new random table.  Requires the Castles & Crusades Ruleset.',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game Disney's Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon is a 3D RTS game focusing on space combat. In the main campaign's story-driven missions, you begin play as Jim Hawkins, a cadet in the Royal Navy's fight against pirates and the deadly Procyon Fleet, with an eye toward eventual promotion to fleet commander. Skirmish and multiplayer modes allow the choice of playing as all three factions.  Successfully completed missions result in ship and fleet enhancements, more experienced crews, and upgraded weapons. Royal Navy Fleet weapons are only slightly inferior to the reworked weapons of the Procyon Fleet but are sturdier and less vulnerable. Ships for the Royal Navy range from torpedo boats and war sloops to escorts, frigates, and the impressive StarHammer, while pirates man sloops, gunboats, schooners, assault cutters, and more, including several unique designs like the carrack and barque. The Procyon Fleet is built for speed and maneuverability, geared for fast hit-and-run attacks, and as the game progresses, news of a mysterious Ironclad Fleet surfaces as well.  Ship designs in Battle at Procyon are fashioned after the seafaring ships from the golden age of sail, with solar winds filling the sails and rigging. Arsenals reflect futuristic models of light, medium, and heavy weapons such as laserball and plasma cannons, beam weapons, Gatling guns, harpoons, fire and net launchers, gravity waves, torpedoes, mortars, and more. Other features include multiple waypoint settings, star maps, panic fire, secondary ship control, docking, repairing, towing, grappling, and boarding actions.\",\n",

We realize and recognize the issues that a lot of Steam Early Access games go through. That being said, if you are expecting a final and complete experience, do not buy this game . The game will be undergoing a lot of changes with our new community's guidance and support. If you are still interested — buying this game does fund it to make it a better game. We want to work with you to make it better! Let's talk! We do not plan on banning users on our Community Discussion page. We do expect some level of civility, but we will not be enforcing any rules at this time. We want to hear all of it. —————————————————————————————————————————————————————— SilverQuest: Gaiden is retro dungeon crawling at its purest. FM Synth sounds and music bring you deep into a world of dungeon exploration where each game is a new experience! All art, items, enemies … everything is exposed outside of the game, meaning anyone can add, remove or change anything in the game. Add 1,000 monsters, quests, release your own mod-pack, anything! Mod-packs are officially supported, and can be downloaded on the Steam Workshop page when they are available. Our game is a great way to start learning how games work. We encourage you to tinker with everything! Thank you for your time, understanding and interest. We'll see you on the Community Discussion page!

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game Cattle and Crops is a new generation of farming simulation designed with special attention to detail. You have the choice: control the vehicles yourself and experience realistic driving or leave the work to your employees, lean back and enjoy the field ballet. Highly detailed machinery, realistic harvesting methods, original sounds and an authentic vehicle physics system offer you a compelling experience in Cattle and Crops. Experience the varied everyday life of a farmer. Choose between a story mode or free play. The game also provides additional tutorial missions to make you familiar with the simulation. Hire employees to cultivate your fields, or to assist you when you’re harvesting. You can delegate tasks with your calendar and watch your employees do their job or take care of the work in front of you on your own. Cattle and Crops provides a complex employee system where the workers take care not to damage the harvest. Skillfully avoid unnecessary driving tracks on the field to keep soil compaction low so your plants can spread their roots in the loose soil to maximize the yield. Take care of your crops so don’t hang their heads and make your fields prosper. Plant growth (using the real BBCH scale) is based on multiple soil attributes like moisture, pH value, temperature, sunshine hours, NPK fertilizer and diseases. Gather the harvest at the right time and try not to get stuck in the mud when it’s raining. Cattle and Crops offers a range of big, well known industry brands such as CLAAS, Köckerling, Lemken, Mercedes-Benz and a lot more. Extend the game with your own vehicles, implements and maps. We’re providing you with all the tools you need for it.',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game  Tactical digital board game in the world of Dark Ages! Features Six factions with unique generals and squads: the nimble nomads of the Horde, the well-armored and disciplined Imperial soldiers, the mad Normanna clad in furs, the League’s guilds wielding gunpowder, the proud knights of the Order, and the exotic cults of the Mesopotamia. Over 50 types of squads based on real historical troops. No armored bikinis or spiked pauldrons here! By surviving battles, your squads gain experience and develop their skills. Fresh recruits have nothing on a seasoned veteran. Generals are the linchpin of a squad, and their skills and abilities can drastically change the outcome of a battle. Each general has a unique personality generated at the beginning of each game. Each has their own appearance, character traits, and abilities. It's impossible to predict who will appear the next go ‘round: a brave but simple knight, a talented but greedy tactical genius, or a bloodthirsty barbarian who instills fear in friend and foe alike. A pantheon of chosen generals: put your greatest leaders here to re-use them from campaign to campaign, or hire legendary figures feared and revered throughout history, such as Joan of Arc and Genghis Khan. The numerous scenarios offer a huge variety of different challenges: win a civil war, fight off nomads, deal with pirates raiding the coast, save a kingdom ravaged by plague, or crush a peasant uprising. Battle formations: effective positioning of your troops is half the battle. Tactical tricks, feints, and ambushes are at your disposal. Win your battles through quality, not quantity. Terrain and weather: even the perfect army may lose in unfavorable conditions. It’s generally a good idea to lure enemy cavalry into a bog, under your arrows – but remember that rain and fog make your archers useless. Upgrade your soldiers’ weapons and armor at the royal forge. Dark Ages is a turn-based strategy game set in the violent world of an alternate Middle Ages. Vikings against war elephants, musketeers against the Mongol cavalry, ancient phalanx legions against crusaders; the deadliest armies in history clashing in bloody war. An army without leadership is merely a mob. In Dark Ages, troops follow the lead of their commanders: unique leaders with their own virtues, vices, talents, and weaknesses. Take the throne of a small kingdom being torn apart by feuds and threatened by militant neighbors, and try to survive the Dark Ages.\",\n",

You are strongly recommended to find the product there and make your purchase from within the game.  In order to be able to use this add-on livery product, you MUST first own the BR Class 20 Loco Add-On. If you check in the in-game store it will verify if you own it before you purchase.  The Bo-Bo Class 20 ‘Chopper’ is now available for Train Simulator in BR Blue livery.  Built initially from 1957 to 1962, and then again from 1966 until 1968, the 228 locomotives in the Class were designed to haul freight, but were often pressed into service during the summer months on seaside specials.  Known by their nickname ‘Choppers’, a name derived from the distinctive beat that the engine produced under load and resembling the sound of a helicopter, the Class 20’s relatively low power output – 1,000 horsepower – saw many operate in pairs across the British rail network. This was also due to the poor visibility caused by their long nose, which saw the locomotives run almost exclusively cab first.',\n",

However, something about him is different. Sora has two sisters who feel a strong sexual attraction to him. They want him to feel the same and, for this reason, they intentionally play their erotic games in front Sora, hoping to turn him on. The girls take every chance to seduce their brother, which means that they do their dirty little tricks not only at home but also in public where everyone can see them. This has already caused Sora some trouble. Needless to say, the whole situation has turned Sora into the subject of gossip. His male classmates envy him greatly while all the girls think he is a pervert. Will Sora`s sisters manage to seduce their own brother? The question remains.',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game Colour Box is a puzzle game about colouring boxes. There are 27 levels of varying difficulty that may prove to be both challenging and fun! You play the game by dragging boxes around. Dragging one over a coloured field will colour the part of the box touching that field. You must drag a matching box to the goal to complete a level. The main challenge of the game is figuring out in which order you should colour the box (or boxes). To beat the game you have to think logically and use all the tools the game provides you with. We hope you have as much fun playing Colour Box as we had making it! The game is made by Daniel Michaneck and features music by Jonathan Krieger Rozenberg. A big thank you to the people that playtested the game and the helpful members of the GameMaker community. Tips If you are having trouble dragging the box you can turn on Drag Assist in the main menu to make it easier for you. You can open the menu by pressing the Escape button or by right-clicking on an area away from a box or a goal. You can skip to the next level by pressing the right arrow key or go back to the previous level by pressing the left arrow key. You can go back a step in the menu or continue the game session by pressing the right mouse button while in the menu. You can also go back a step or continue the session by left-clicking outside of the menu screen while the game is paused. ',\n",

If you are not comfortable with using a mouse for skillful play, you will most likely not enjoy this game. Quick Slick Deadly is all about learning the game's mechanics and mastering them for reaching high scores. Compared to other Shoot 'em Ups, the mechanics are plenty. They are explained via short text+voice messages at the start of every mission. It is essential to pay attention to these pieces of information, or else you will not understand how to play. If you do not have the patience for this, this game is not for you. Game Summary Fly through space and overcome a variety of enemies and obstacles as one of three different classes. As the Fighter, you'll fire a weapon that although very weak covers an increasingly larger area if you continue to destroy your enemies. You'll also be able to copy the attacks of your enemies by destroying three of a kind in a row! As the Survivor, you'll gain energy by daring to get close to enemy attacks. You could use this energy to either block attacks or wait for maximum energy to perform a screen-filling attack. If you manage to reach a high speed, your ship enters ghost-mode and becomes invincible! As the Trickster, you'll be able to perform various risky maneuvers to unleash powerful attacks. Wield a boomerang that is deadly to your enemies but takes away your control over your ship. Use energy to inflict great damage that returns enemy attack damage right back at them! If you have enough speed you'll be able to destroy your foes by simply crashing into them! Learn to master Quick Slick Deadly through step-by-step missions and then show off the hardcore gamer within you with your perfected high-scores and excellent completion times. Are you ready to face a challenge? For more information, check out the in-depth guide at: https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/399270/manuals/In-Depth_Guide_to_Quick_Slick_Deadly.pdf?t=1450297586 Key Features Play as three completely different classes: Fighter; Survivor; and Trickster. Probably the only scrolling shooter where the scrolling speed of the screen is not fixed, but can be manipulated by the player, adding the possibility to do time trials besides the usual score hunting. While mostly side-scrolling, the view occasionally switches to top-view to enable more interesting gameplay situations. It’s not all about shooting, but also about maneuvering. The various environmental hazards underline this feature, which are not only deadly to you, but also to your enemies. \",\n",

Through the use of human agents these horrors work to thwart mankind’s destiny. However, not all of these human agents are willing partners. Many times have the monsters resorted to subtlety and intrigue to further their ends, rather than gross displays of sheer destruction. Andrew Keetling is one such unwilling agent. A sucessful Boston businessman, he has disappeared — held captive in a mansion of madness. MANSIONS OF MADNESS is a collection of six independent tales for Call of Cthulhu. Set in the 1920s and of varying length and complexity, these adventures can be planted into an ongoing campaign as the keeper sees fit. Some can be played in a single night, others will require several evenings to complete. They can readily be used as plot twists, interesting diversions, or red herrings.

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game  Story  War... No one knows when or how it started. In the lands controlled by humans, one fights in the name of peace and justice, one battles for no reason other than to fight, one battles out of greed, to gain more land, and like this, they all faded in the fighting. The victor edits history to put them in a favorable light, and removes anything that they deem unflattering... As a result, humanity has lost many things to the wars. Territory, technology, and their true history... Now there\\'s not a single country that’s lasted more than 50 years... Description Lost Technology is a real-time-strategy (RTS) siege game. The game is centred around three major phases: Phase One: Turn-Based War Strategy Recruit units, and build your army. Find those who will fight for you, command their movements and formation to smoothly prepare to assault your enemy’s territories, or being diplomacy to build peaceful and prosperous relations. Phase Two: Real-Time Battle Co-ordinate your army and navigate them through the battle field. With a variety of terrains, attacks and formations, utilize them all to overpower and defeat your enemy. Phase Three: Story Event Play through scenarios, each triggered by special events within the game. Your choices and interactions here will affect your strategy and progression.  You must take control of all territories to complete the game. The World At a glance, the world of Lost Technology appears to resemble the Middle Ages, as well as a fantasy setting. However, civilization had once exceeded our current level of scientific advancement. This drastic difference in advancement is due to the decaying effects of ongoing war. What remains in the game is the world experienced by the player. Long ago when the realms were undivided, there existed incredibly advanced technology that we could not even imagine.  This technology would be: \"Weaponry\", \"Ideology\", \"Appliances\", \"Theory\", \"Manufacture\", \"Speech\", \"Craft\", \"Knowledge\", \"Study\" and \"Law\"... A wide range of fields that were developed over long periods of history.  However, most of this has now been lost through the endless wars. The player\\'s mission is to choose a single power and bring an end to the wars, once again creating a world of peace. Game Structure  Turn-Based War Strategy Phase Real-Time Battle Phase Story Event Phase War Strategy Phase (Turn-Based) Form your squad Assemble your ideal team of warriors. Attack Once prepared, move to attack the enemy region. Recruit troops Recruit standard troops and strengthen your army. Recruit comrades You can recruit powerful comrades in your region. Diplomacy Deepen your bonds with those you would rather not fight. Battle Phase (Real-Time) Move your army into battle. Command your army into various formations. Lead your solders into battle with a variety of attacks. Many components are automatic, allowing for a good flow and making each engagement short and satisfying. Event phase There are various factors which can trigger the event phase. You increased your territory. You befriended a specific comrade. Your territory borders another country. You destroyed another country. You met a certain comrade on the battlefield. The event will display story text with occasional choices to be made by the player. Features Over 100 comrade units (generals) with their own beautiful illustrations by Agahari! Carefully chosen music samples, as well as compositions from the legendary Cranky! The differences between the Japanese and English versions This is a game has a large amount of story text for each playable faction. Ideally we would like to provide fully localized versions for each respective faction, however, the size and scale of the game meant that a full localization would be extremely difficult to provide all at once, and so only the six factions known as the Reinald Empire, Makan, Álfheim, Kingdom of Gug, Castus and Dragon Knights of Fevnr are included in the English release. It is possible to start with any of the other playable factions, but story events will not occur and only the simulation part of the game may be played. The Japanese version still contains the currently available free version, all of the basic functions without changes, and all factions are included in full right off the bat. (We had to remove some fan content from the build due to the copyright issues though.) However, it will be distributed as a paid title due to adjustments made specifically for Steam and the addition of trading cards, etc. We currently plan to look carefully at how this title sells (including sales within Japan) and will proceed with the localization of the remaining factions in accordance with the sales numbers. The remaining factions are set to be distributed as additional DLC in the future. Please stay tuned for more news regarding further details. With your support, we hope to provide players with Lost Technology in its full glory! Developer\\'s Voice - Developer: CB-SXF6 We’ve finally managed to make our way up to release. We’ve come quite a long way in the two-plus years since PLAYISM first reached out to us on March 16th, 2015. Lost Technology is an appropriation of a game program called Vahrenturga. Vahrenturga was the winner of the 2009 game contest held by the major Japanese free game posting site Freem!, and boasts over 200,000 downloads. I became obsessed with this game and spent an immeasurable amount of time playing it before subsequently becoming obsessed with creating mods, and then finally using the game system to create my own original title. That title is Lost Technology. Therefore, this program wasn’t created by our team, and the cooperation of the creator of the original game “Nanaashi”, was absolutely necessary for us to be able to release Lost Technology overseas. Nanaashi was extremely happy to hear about our plans for an English version, and I myself was a huge fan of Vahrenturga, so I did everything in my power to ensure that this game could be released. In Japanese, kanji characters can be utilized to shorten all sorts of texts, but that’s not possible in English. There are some parts in which the text simply could not be made shorter. Due to this, we often had issues with the game screen requiring tweaking in order to keep all of the necessary text visible and in place. Each time this occurred, Nanaashi helped immensely by accepting our requests for the required tweaks and adjustments. Furthermore, we also had some very serious problems with differences in non-Japanese OS text encoding, and these problems became so serious at one point that we actually came close to giving up on the release altogether. However, Nanaashi was somehow able to figure out and solve the source of these problems, allowing us to finally bring the game to release. I honestly cannot thank Nanaashi enough. To all of our overseas players who enjoy Lost Technology: I would be enthralled if all of you would check out and play Vahrenturga as well since it\\'s game program can be used freely, so as long as you have the various materials in place, you, too, can make your very own original strategy SLG on the same game system. - \"Vahrenturga\" developer: Nanaashi Congratulations on the release of the English version of Lost Technology. As the creator of the original, I am truly honored to have Vahrenturga used as the base system for this expansive strategy-simulation title featuring beautiful illustrations, music, and voice work. Thank you very much. - \"Hatoful Boyfriend\" developer, and writer for the Kingdom of Gug Scenario: Hato Moa Congratulations on Lost Technology and the English release of the Kingdom of Gug scenario! It’s really deeply moving to think that those funky frogs are setting off out into the world. Since it is, after all, a music-themed scenario, please be sure to check out the awesome original songs, too. Have fun! Frequently Asked Questions See all the questions here. ',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game Ramen spends a lot of time considering how best to spend his last productive days. He recently learned that some silent investors for a small pizza restaurant have secretly hidden their tax returns deep in a privately owned local uranium mine. He insisted on revealing the source of their dirty money to the public and it’s gotten him into some hot water. He snuck his way inside the mine, found out where they keep the records, and just before he strapped the documents to his back in preparation to leave, he thought “Will this be a worthwhile escape?” He then enthusiastically blindfolded himself for added danger! He didn’t know you were coming to help, he barely knows you’re there, and he doesn’t think he needs you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to guide and protect Ramen during his passage through the dangerous valley. Keep him alive so the truth about those crooks can be brought to light.  In this game, you start with an birds eye view of a map full of obstacles and enemies. You must first chart the path across the playing field that Ramen, the character you are escorting and protecting, will follow once the action starts. Simultaneously, you can purchase ammunition and powerups that will assist you for the successful completion of each stage. Enemies and obstacles are randomly distributed at the start of each match. Every match is unique. Once you click \"Ready\", you can start to clear enemies from the map. There is a fixed number of enemies that will spawn. It is recommended that you take down each group of enemies using the type of munition that\\'s designed to do the most damage to that enemy type as that will allow you to start the final boss fight with the most firepower at your disposal. The boss is the same character on every map but his behavior is dependent on your play style. If you collect all the hidden folders, clear a sufficient amount of enemies, and get Ramen across the finish line with full health, you will have defeat the game with a perfect score.',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Content Purchasing Chucho Krokk will permanently unlock this character in Awesomenauts. The character can also be purchased with Awesomepoints in-game. Chucho Krokk is a moderately-challenging fighter that is very mobile on his bike. Can step off, leaving his bike as a static turret. Can throw bombs that stick to enemies and deal area damage after a delay. He comes equipped with the following abilities: Step on your bike to drive into combat with increased speed and a directional shot. When you dismount you'll deploy your bike as a rapid shooting turret. Throw a sticky bomb to stick onto anything. Explodes in an area after being stuck for some time. This skill changes into a Nitro Boost when on your bike. Shoot two successive shots each time. Changes into a forward rapid shot when on your bike. Chucho comes from a rich, if slightly shady family called the Krokk. Let’s face facts here: they may have achieved fame and fortune on Calias by hunting down the biggest criminals in the galaxy, but they’re just as bad themselves. But hey, it takes a crook to catch a crook, so Chucho has taken up the family mantle of being a BAD-ASS BOUNTY HUNTER. Which wouldn’t be so awkward if he didn’t have the world’s largest lisp. Oh well. No time for that, because the self-styled “Time Krokk” is on the hunt for a time traveling criminal (a practice strictly forbidden under the intergalactic portal law, ever since someone went back in time to steal cocoa beans for a fondue, and accidentally ended up wiping out chocolate from history). Since the Krokks and Zorks have been vicious rivals for centuries he raised quite some eyebrows when out of nowhere he signed up for the Awesomenauts. In his inventory rests a suspicious, smelly time traveling slipper that might lead him to an altogether deadly confrontation with his unsuspecting bounty... The Krokk have been suspected of working together with many criminal organizations such as Shisu, the underwater maffia, the religious clown killers known as the Grint and some even suspect links with the lizard Sisterhood of Coba. None of these have ever been confirmed, however. Chucho's homeplanet is Calias which is a rich and tech-heavy planet. A lot of rich industrial corporations are based here mainly due to the mining of power crystals on Luxor, Calias' last moon. \",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content  Total War: THREE KINGDOMS – Yellow Turban Rebellion Warlord Pack A brand-new sub-culture to play as: rekindle the Yellow Turban Rebellion, lead their struggle against the corrupt Han and bring about the Era of Great Peace Three new playable Warlords; He Yi, Gong Du, and Huang Shao Three new hero classes: Healer, Scholar, and Veteran A unique and versatile unit roster composed of a cross-section of society: Militias formed from the forgotten and downtrodden masses fight side by side with disgruntled soldiers, religious zealots and former officials, united in a common cause Brand new approach to technology focusing on interpreting the ‘Three Books of Great Peace’ New character skills focused on the three virtues of Taoism: Frugality, Compassion, and Humility New weapons and armour suitable for the new heroes. We are the poor and the oppressed. We are the common-folk; the farmers and the soldiers; the Han Dynasty’s forgotten multitude. Oh Emperor, we are your people. And yet you languish in the imperial palace, eunuchs and nobles whispering falsehoods in your ear. You do their bidding. You are their puppet. Even as we starve, you tax us ever harder, that they may continue to live in luxury. When we rose in opposition, you slaughtered us in our millions. Many more were slain by your agents on suspicion alone. It is clear to us now: you have lost the Mandate of Heaven. We are the poor and the oppressed. But we are also the many. We are the very backbone of China. We wear the yellow turban with pride. And we bring great change. The Blue Sky is dead; the Yellow Sky will soon rise. In the year of Jiazi, there will be prosperity under Heaven! Overview The Yellow Turbans were a rebel movement of the common people, founded on spiritual beliefs. Tired of oppression, starvation and injustice at the hands of the Han Dynasty, they rose up against the corrupt nobility. Prior to the start of this campaign, a massive Yellow Turban rebellion had swept through China led by the Zhang brothers, who used Taoist divination to predict the fall of the Han dynasty. However, this initial rebellion was ruthlessly crushed and millions of civilians suspected of being sympathisers were slaughtered without mercy. As the campaign begins, the Zhang brothers are already dead, and only three significant enclaves of Yellow Turbans remain. Playing as one of these factions, you can change history, rekindling the movement and uniting China under a rightful, virtuous and just Emperor. Yellow Turban Factions The Yellow Turbans’ beliefs blend Taoism and shamanistic principles, and these spiritual aspects are a recurring theme throughout their faction gameplay. Many of their features relate to the three Taoist domains of Land, People and Heaven, or the Three Treasures (or virtues) of Taoism: Frugality, Compassion, and Humility. Reflecting these concepts, the playable Yellow Turban factions are led by the characters He Yi (People), Gong Du (Land) and Huang Shao (Heaven). Each has their own playstyle and unique bonuses. Yellow Turban factions construct a mix of adapted Han buildings and their own unique structures. Their technology tree is divided into three scrolls from the Book of Great Peace, each of which references the three Taoist domains and contains verses of Taoist scripture. It is structurally and mechanically very different from the default tech trees used by other factions. Playable Yellow Turban factions improve their Faction Rank as their campaigns progress. These represent the journey to enlightenment, the achievement of The Great Peace, regaining the Mandate of Heaven, and appointing a just Emperor. Progression requires the player to study the verses in the Book of Great Peace, construct religious building in their settlements and improve the virtuous characteristics of the characters under their control. Characters The Yellow Turbans have three playable heroes representing their factions. Each has their own playstyle, unique building chain and faction bonuses: He Yi is a Yellow Turban commander from Yu province. Like the original founders of the Yellow Turban movement, he is a Healer, and empathises with the suffering of the common people. He is able to rally vast masses to the cause of the rebellion. Representing the domain of People, He Yi espouses Compassion. He fields veteran Yellow Turban warriors and strong berserkers in battle, and has access to the Healer’s Lodge unique building chain, a multifunctional building boosting population growth and replenishment and generating a small income from the sale of medicine. Gong Du is a Veteran. Originally a bandit leader in the Changsha area, he aided Ou Xing in his rebellion against Sun Jian. He is a former military commander, and something of a charming brigand: well-liked and popular with the troops. He is dedicated to claiming the spoils from the tyrants he overthrows. Representing the domain of Land, Gong Du espouses frugality. He fields former soldiers, guardsmen and converted nobles in battle and can build the unique Hidden Fort building chain that helps supply the Yellow Turban armies and increases the amount of spoils they can carry off after a battle. Huang Shao is a Scholar, and a Yellow Turban commander from Yu Province. He is the only leader to have met the original founders of the Yellow Turban rebellion. As such, he best understands their spiritual teachings, and aims to ensure the rebellion doesn’t lose its way on the road to realising The Great Peace. Representing the domain of Heaven, Huang Shao espouses Humility. He fields religious fanatics, spiritual martial artists and scholars in battle, and can build the Gardens unique building, a tranquil place that helps keep both the people and the characters under Huang Shao’s control happy.',\n",

Leatherface won’t fail and he won’t stop. As the chainsaw starts, you know what is coming. Pain and fear in a combination of panic as you understand that death isn’t the end. You will also end up on someone’s plate. As the saw starts... What happens when the body grows but the mind can’t keep up? A child’s fears and anxiety, but trapped inside a fully grown man’s body. A furious body wielding a chainsaw? Someone who knows what happens as you disobey your family. What happens if anyone finds out what’s in the stew. Leatherface is not only the skin clad maniac with a disturbed mind. He seeks acceptance and appreciation. He’s learned the hard way and was molded to what he now is. A watchdog, a guardian, a blind gate keeper who never questions. And all problems can be solved with his chainsaw. Killer Power - Leatherface: Bubba’s Chainsaw An incredibly powerful and heavy Chainsaw which sank its teeth in countless victims. A suiting birthday gift to The Cannibal.

Game Plumbing \"Toxic threat\" is of the long-known genre of \"plumber \", but you will be pleasantly surprised by the changes that bring variety to the gameplay. The game will be interesting for everyone from novices to pros. The game has 20 levels, which differ: - Simple levels - which will help you to practice logic games and how to construct a pipeline. At these levels have no restrictions, can be long and hard to find the right solution;  - For time – after simple training levels, we will complicate the task, now every level has a time limit, be careful while choosing the desired position of pipes, if time runs out, you have to start the level again; - With limited turn-out of pipes, can you easily cope with the levels on time ? Then let\\'s complicate the task now each pipe can only be turned 4 times, after those it will break, be careful, because there are the pipes without which you can\\'t force in to the correct path of the pipeline. In advance, think before you twist the tube and watch the time;  - Filter – and here are the new levels, now at level, there is a filter that separates the toxins into the water and poison. Here it is necessary to hold the pipe to the filter and from the filter to the pipe in two directions, clean water back to the tree, but the poison to collect in the barrel, also do not forget about the separation of turn-outs and time; -With different directions – and finally, the most difficult levels. Here you will have to think carefully, because the correct version of the pipeline is only one, you need to correctly make a plumbing, but at some point it will be split into two or even three directions, which extremely complicates task, and you shouldn\\'t forget about the time and limitation of the turn-outs of the pipes.',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game  The Game 24 Hours ‘Til Rescue plunges you into dynamic, hand-crafted, city overrun by the undead with one, simple premise: to escape the city alive. Yet, with most of the streets barricaded, all of them teeming with enemies, and with rescue not coming for another 24 hours, the chances of survival are slim to none. If you want to escape you are going to have to head out into the streets, find fellow survivors, scavenge the city for guns, ammo and food, and undertake a terrifying quest that will lead you into the bowels of the infected hospital, through the rat infested sewers, and to the home of the crazy mayor. The world is never going to be the same again! Features: 10 playable characters each with different stats, bonuses, and starting locations within the city. Permadeath - When you die, you die! There is a non permadeath mode but high-scores are not saved. Crafting - Craft guns and ammo, and cook restorative snacks, from hundreds of lootable items. Day and night system with real darkness! Looting - From gun shops, through houses, to the mayor's mansion: every building is lootable. Time specific events such as characters that die at certain times. A truly difficult experience where beating your own high-score is often far more achievable than beating the game. Warning: This game is designed to be difficult…. very difficult. It would be almost impossible to complete the game on the first run through, even if you had access to the best characters, best guns, and didn’t play on the default ‘Permadeath’ mode: the story of the city unfolds so that you learn more with each character and with each play through. Dying is part of the game – if that doesn’t appeal, it’s probably best to move on! The characters: You can start the game as ten different characters, each with different bonuses, skills, and starting locations within the city. However, on your first run through you will only be able to select two of them, the others can be unlocked if you can find them within the city, before they are eaten alive. Some characters are hiding in houses, others in the streets, but the more you find the easier the game becomes, not only because you have alternate starting points but also because when you meet them, they will join you as a companion! The world: The game is set in a dynamic city where events happen at specific times over the 24 hours. Some things can be done at any time, others within a time limit. This can make the game even more challenging. To make your life easier however the world is jam-packed with lootable items, some of which can be used directly like armour, weapons, and ammo, and others which can be used to cook and craft. There are also special items which can only be found in certain locations (or with certain starting characters) like the fuel siphoner, chainsaw fuel converter, and keys! This game uses the engine of, and is a prequel to, 'Apocalypse Hotel: The Post-Apocalyptic Hotel Simulator!' by Flynnfour Games - Though it shares an engine it is a very different game and is definitely worth a look. Indeed, we liked it so much that we collaberated in making this spin-off! The quest: In order to leave the city you are tasked with retrieving a sample taken from patient 0. This will mean a descent into the bowels of the infested hospital. Yet not all is as it seems and you will find yourself buffeted from one mission to another with hardly time to craft more ammo or cook up some health snacks before you find yourself sent off to another location to kill some beastie, fetch some data, or stop the crazy mayor from doing something you’ll all regret!\",\n",

The fight scheduled today will draw exceptionally massive crowds, meaning the fight purse will be bountiful and the opportunity to place a large volume of bets will be high. One problem though: your top fighter is fatigued from his last fight and has a nagging shoulder strain. Plus he has a history of concussions, so it’s fair to say he will not be at full strength if you put him in the arena. But he’s the best you’ve got. The rest of your gladiators are rookies yet; still working with your trainers and far too inexperienced to send into the crucible just yet. The next fight is a week away and poorly hyped. You cannot wait that long. If you were of an evil disposition, you could execute your top fighter instead and seize his life savings; with the fight purses you have shared with him through his career, he has amassed a lot of gold. It could keep you going for a month or two - maybe more. Something to consider. Or if you find that distasteful, you could go to the money lenders instead. But their interest rates have been high these last few days: 30% or more. You could finance present operations with that – but you would suffer in the longer term. So maybe you should send your top fighter into the arena. He is bruised up and fatigued – but he also is ranked 3rd overall by the so-called experts and pundits of Leptis Magnus, the current city you reside in. You know he is one of the best and might still have a good chance at pulling out a win. Or he could lose his life. What do you do? What Is It? Age of Gladiators is a single-player strategy/business management sim set at the height of the bloody gladiatorial games in ancient Rome. Hire scouts to scour the provinces for potential prospects – once you have recruited your gladiators, you will need to manage their morale and personality while equipping them for battle in the arenas. Recruit support staff, upgrade your stables, partake in side missions, and manage the wealth and reputation of your business as it grows each day. As your fighters win battles and increase in level, it will be up to you to decide how to focus their abilities by spending attribute and expertise points. Compete, trade, and interact with other in-game bosses as you work your way up from the starting provinces in Africa to the grand coliseum of Rome herself! Features: Gladiators are born with their own dynamically generated attributes (strength, agility, stamina, dexterity, reflexes, intelligence, and health), weapon specialties, and personalities. It is up to you to hire scouts to locate the best prospects available for recruitment. Manage your stable of gladiators carefully – their morale, greed, injuries, fatigue, and more must be taken into account before sending them to battle. The physicality of your gladiators will increase or decrease with age, depending on if they are in their prime or declining. Fame system: as your gladiators gain glory from battle, they will become more widely recognized and adored by the crowds. Win enough battles and they may even get voted into the gladiatorial hall of fame after they retire (or die). Watch as your fighters climb the all-time records list for wins, kills, and fame - all held by retired and still-active legends in the arena. As your gladiators level up, they gain points to spend on their attributes and expertise. Expertise allows you to build and customize your fighter according to their appropriate strengths. Purchase, sell, or trade fighters with opposing bosses. Rob treasuries, kidnap enemy fighters, assassinate your debt holders and more with the quest system. Increase the odds of success by sending gladiators on the mission as well. Search for deals on weapons, armor, and money loans on the marketplace. Hire staff such as scouts, doctors, trainers and blacksmiths to help your gladiators achieve victory. Your staff will gain experience each day they are employed. Upgrade your stable by improving its food, bedding, shelter, and more. Strive to become the wealthiest individual in the entire Roman republic. There are quick and underhanded ways to make money, but your reputation and fighter’s morale may suffer as a result. Receive taunting letters from opposing bosses as well as various other messages from your fighters, staff members, and different characters as you progress through the game. Rename your gladiators in order to increase your attachment toward them. Bet for or against your gladiator based on the odds generated by bookmakers in-game. Fight purses and betting is based on the hype associated with each match. The greater the hype, the more lucrative the fight purse and betting market will be - but the opposition will also be tougher. Each game is dynamically generated and different each time. Other Age of Gladiators is a twist on sports front office games like Out Of The Park Baseball or the Football Manager series. To continue the analogy, it was designed for people more interested in the strategy behind building up teams and players as a general manager rather than running the games tactically as coach. As well, the strategy element should appeal to fans of Paradox and other franchises in that genre.',\n",

The new skin is applied when downloaded (to revert, simply uninstall). Estalian Leather Coat The Estalian Kingdoms lie far to the south, where the threat of Chaos  seems very remote. Like the Border Princes, Estalia is a collection of petty kingdoms. Unlike the Border Princes, however, Estalians  face no threat from Orcs and Goblins so they mostly fight amongst themselves. There is little evidence of the influence of Chaos in the Estalian Kingdoms, but it is there. Subtle perhaps, but no less deadly. It is not the brute power of the raging Beastman, but the hidden plotting of secret societies and cults which is eating away at distant Estalia. There are no Witch Hunters hunting Chaos in Estalia, but worship of Myrmidia is popular. She is patron Goddess of the art and science of war and the Estalians have learned her lessons well. If Tilea is known for its mercenaries, Estalia is known for its duellists. Fencing schools can be found throughout the region, many with long histories and deadly rivalries.',\n",

If you're new to the series, this is a good place to start, and if you've played the other games, there's plenty of new features for you to explore.  Epic Battle Fantasy 5 features... Over 170 different enemies to fight, all with unique abilities and attack patterns. Over 120 usable skills, and more equips than you can try out in a single playthrough. Almost any enemy can be captured like a Pok*mon, and later summoned in battle. (including bosses!) New mechanics also include weather conditions and a cooldown system. (MP is gone!) Set up devastating combos with damage-amplifying status effects. (wet + thunder = massive damage!) 30 hours of gameplay, plus lots of optional dungeons and challenges. Suitable for both casual and hardcore RPG players, and is safe for all ages, if offensive content is disabled. Epic Battle Fantasy 5 does NOT feature... Annoying random battles. Limited save points. Depressed protagonists. Points of no return.  \",\n",

They now await to hear if they will be allowed home, or be executed inside this ship. Edward wants to trust the aliens will make the right choice, but as the decision looms, doubt begins to whisper in his mind.  Bermuda is a visual novel mixed with open ended stealth puzzles. The game is fully voiced, featuring the talent of veteran actors such as Cristina Vee (Madoka Magica), Kira Buckland (Blue Exorcist) and Kyle Hebert (Dragonball). Xanthe Huynh and Skyler Davenport from Unhack also make a return, as well as voice actor Miguel Moran. For players who prefer to read the story like a traditional novel, each character's voice can be toggled individually.  Running at around an hour in length, Bermuda aims to be a succinct story that players can enjoy around their busy schedules. Each episode features bonus conversations, giving players a chance to know the cast better.  Illustrations: Alastair Sew Hoy Music: Matt Hamm  A demo version of Bermuda is available! Please consider checking it out first to ensure the game runs well on your machine.  Thank you! I hope you will find the experience valuable.\",\n",

You are strongly recommended to find the product there and make your purchase from within the game. Includes BR 24.5T mineral wagons and BR iron ore tipplers, each wagon has four weathered varieties apiece and the iron or tippler has both fitted and unfitted varieties. BR 24.5T mineral wagon BR introduced these large flat bottomed mineral wagon in 1952. They continued building them until 1962 with a total of 3395 being built. None were vacuum braked. BR Iron Ore Tippler Prior to WW2 hoppers had been used for iron ore. BR found that it was just as easy to empty the wagons by rotating them on a tippler, removing the need for any doors at all. The BR design is superficially very similar to the 16T coal wagons, however they lack the side and end doors. BR built 8590 unfitted iron ore tipplers, although some of these were converted to vacuum brakes later. BR later built a further batch (1000) which were vacuum braked.',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game  A relaxing hiatus from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Sit in a remote corner of the world, drop a line, and see what bites. Beneath the Surface is a short and relaxing fishing game. The gameplay involves simply dropping a line and waiting for a bite. You can upgrade your fishing rod to be quicker and your line to go deeper. The deeper you go, the more curious and delightful your catches get! This is my first indie venture after working for some bigger studios. I've had practice making mods and fishing games in the past so I thought I'd put my experience toward something that could help me relax a little. I hope it helps you too!

Every golf course is a new surprising type of golf, some brilliant or hilarious, others so absurd they will make you go: WHAT THE GOLF? Golf is always the same: perfectly round balls, 18 holes, blue sky, neatly cut grass and fancy people in nice clothes. What's not to hate? – Hate no more! You must have a lot of questions about our vision for golf. Why is the golfer not part of the game? Driving range? Home in one? Can all ball games be reimagined as golf? What is a First Person Golfer? Are all Olympic Games just special case golf games? Could golf “steal” some ideas from other games? Can you hear people golf in space? How many balls does it take to fix golf? How would you like some FLIPPING golf? If you can imagine it, you can golf it... With advanced video game technology we can turn anything into a golf game. WHAT THE GOLF? is a silly reinvention of golf that doesn't care too much about rules, pars, eagles, or any of that. You get to hit things and they fly away with fun physics. It's a goofy game that borrowed the shooting mechanic from golf but uses it for moving houses, driving cars, and golfing people. WHAT THE GOLF has a wide range of different mini-game like levels that all have slightly different mechanics.

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game  VIRZOOM VR GAMING SYSTEM Virtual Reality Sports “Play VR. Get Fit.”  That’s what VirZOOM does.  We make virtual reality games for an active motion controller where your pedaling and leaning propel you through race tracks, battlegrounds, soaring skies, and pictorial countrysides in the forms of an F1 pilot, a tank commander, a Pegasus, a cyclist, and more. Other online players automatically drop in and drop out of your games to provide competition and cooperation in matches up to 8 players.  Make friends and challenge them to ghost competitions over a period of time, winner take all!  Or choose your own workout and goals, collecting coins along the way to upgrade your avatars. Outside the game you can manage your challenges, tune your workouts, and track your stats on MyVirZOOM and link them to Fitbit and Strava. VirZOOM Arcade Games “VirZOOM Arcade” is our free collection of sport arcade games, available on Steam and the PlayStation Store. Our game controls and physics provide maximum VR comfort to play in large virtual worlds.  No teleporting—your virtual movement reflects your actual movement.  And though the games are designed for our bike controller for sport and exercise, you can also play them for free with a regular controller.  More players means more fun for everyone, step up to a bike when you’re ready! Beyond our games, use the Gamepad Emulator (only available on PC) to turn your bike into a virtual joystick, keyboard, and mouse to play popular games.  Configure your own mappings or use the ones we’ve made for Project Cars, EVE Valkyrie, and Radial-G.  If you’re a developer, from homebrew to AAA, add VirZOOM bike and motion controls to your games for free with our Unity SDK. The VirZOOM Bike Actively experience virtual reality with the VirZOOM Bike Controller, priced and sized for home use by the whole family.  Now try it with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Integrated sensors in the bike track your pedaling speed forward and backward. Not just cadence but the responsiveness you require for high performance gaming.  Triggers and buttons are built into the grips to take air, get bursts of speed, and blast away obstacles.  Lean on the bike to steer naturally using your VR system’s position tracking—our extra wide base keeps you planted! Choose the pedaling resistance that suits you to increase your score or speed or difficulty in our games. Heartrate sensors in the grips determine the calories you burn on every ride. The bike operates silently to be able to hear your games, and folds up easily to move in and out of your play area.  2 AA batteries power it for months to communicate wirelessly to your VR system without cords. VR System Not Included You must have your own VR system to play VirZOOM, but luckily it is compatible with all major systems having position tracking: Oculus Rift (with acceptable PC) HTC Vive (with acceptable PC) Windows Mixed Reality (with acceptable PC) PlayStation VR (with PS4)',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content Climb aboard iconic Austrian traction in the form of the advanced ÖBB 1144 and CityShuttle “Wiesel” from Skyhook Games and Railworks Austria! In the 1990s, passenger capacity on certain routes in Austria were reaching their limits, and something needed to be done to relieve the strain. The solution was the introduction of double-decker coaches, which have the unique ability to increase capacity without requiring longer trains. The first of the new coaches and control cars rolled out in 1997, passenger operations began the same year, and those who travelled on the new coaches were reportedly impressed. The new double-decker coaches – which had been branded as the CityShuttle “Wiesel” (Weasel) – transformed travel across Austria, but not without accompanying traction. They were built with inter-operability in mind, meaning multiple ÖBB locomotives are compatible with the sets, however one locomotive which regularly operates CityShuttle services is the ÖBB 1144. The ÖBB 1144 fleet was built in the mid-1970s as the ÖBB 1044, an electric locomotive that was a powerful solution to Austria’s challenging rail network. They were the backbone of the ÖBB line-up until 2000, when a batch of EuroSprinter locomotives were ordered to assist and eventually replace them. Instead of scrapping the ÖBB 1044s, they were sent to be converted into locomotives capable of push-pull CityShuttle operations, and as a result of the modifications, were reclassified as the ÖBB 1144. Twinned up, the ÖBB 1144 and CityShuttle Wiesel make for a great operational pair, and have arrived in-duo for Train Simulator service, complete with advanced features.  Included Scenarios (Wiesel) – Across the Borders (Wiesel) – REX 5598 (Wiesel) – REX 5571 (Wiesel) – Special Snow Train Please Note: Three Country Corner Route Add-On is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content The demise of steam traction in North America during the 1940s saw the birth of the hard-working GE 44 Tonner switcher, now available for Train Simulator in the livery of Boston & Maine, one of the most dominant railroads of the northern New England region. On the eve of World War II, steam in North America began to be replaced by diesel traction, and a number of switchers were introduced by GE Transportation Systems for industrial and light duties. More than 380 locomotives were produced between 1940 and 1956, with different variants produced for the US Armed Forces, Indian Government and the Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses. The GE 44 Tonner for Train Simulator, developed by DigitalTrainModel, is available in Boston & Maine livery and features opening cab doors and windows, and interior and gauge lighting. The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the GE 44 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for Portland Terminal (available separately and required to play these scenarios). Scenarios Four scenarios for Portland Terminal: First Aid!

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content  Castles & Crusades DB2: Crater of Umeshti A Castles & Crusades Adventure module for Fantasy Grounds Thousands of years ago by the recollections of those elves still alive to recall the fable, a great time of tumult and chaos reigned across the universe. In that time the ancient citadel city of Umeshti was known as a bastion of civilization through the dark night of conflict and madness. Temples to the gods and towers of wizardry were erected, as were libraries and civic enterprises designed to preserve and protect the knowledge that the firstborn civilizations had worked so hard to gain. Art and science flourished, as did the first development of music and poetry. Travelers from far and wide, including those who traveled across the many planes considered Umeshti a home away from home, bringing esoteric relics and fantastic wealth with them. As is often the case, this great civilization thrived and grew, until outside powers began to covet its success. Deities not worshipped within the city began to hurl curses upon its citizens, raining down deific plagues, or striking it divine storms and hordes of monstrous beasts. Despite this, the citizenry showed great inner strength and resolve, facing each new disaster with its own set of champions and brave protectors. In the end, the sages are uncertain, but it is said that during a great war between the gods, a meteor was hurled at Umeshti, driving a shaft into the earth that stretched for hundreds of feet beneath the surface, completely obliterating all but the scantest trace of the powerful society which had once lived there. All that remains now is a massive crater, high atop a mountain plateau, and the darkened shaft at the bottom of the crater, said to lead to treasures unimaginable and profound, if any survive to retrieve them. In the millennia since the destruction of Umeshti, the gaping sink-hole at the center of the crater has been the source of much controversy and speculation. That the area surrounding the shaft left behind by the meteor is infested with all manner of monstrous beast and twisted goblinoid is well documented by those adventurers who have returned alive from expeditions to the crater. The Crater of Umeshti is a good old fashioned dungeon crawl. Characters enter the Crater and delve into its depths. They find foes both great and small and face them in battles of blade or wit in order to relieve them of their treasure. They face puzzles, traps, and uncover secrets and mysteries which inevitably lead the characters to greater power and fortune. The Crater of Umeshti may be incorporated with its other parts into a fantastic campaign, leading characters from levels 2-5 to greater and greater strength and prestige. The crater is designed with the intent of repeated forays into its depths using a nearby settlement of the CK\\'s choice or the characters design to re-stock, refurbish and re-supply. This settlement may be found in pre-made adventure sourcebook of which there are many in both D20 and Castles and Crusades various product lines such as Yggsburg by Gary Gygax, or this authors own city settings such as Dro Madras or that incorrigible chain of cross dimensional taverns known by most as \"The Roadhouse\" and referred to by a knowledgeable few as \"Dirty\\'s\". See The Haunted Highlands by Troll Lord Games for more details on Dirty Bowbe\\'s Roadhouse and its environs. For 4-6 characters of levels 3-5. The difficulty and level needed to overcome new obstacles increases as the PCs delve deeper into the sinkhole in the center of the crater. The adventure requires nothing more than the Castles and Crusades Players Handbook, however Castle Keepers or the CK may find the Castles and Crusade: Monsters and Treasure book by Troll Lord Games to be helpful in running the adventure. Begin the Adventure with: DB1 The Haunted Highland The difficulty and level needed to overcome new obstacles increases as the PCs delve deeper into the sinkhole in the center of the crater. The adventure requires nothing more than the Castles and Crusades Players Handbook, however Castle Keepers or the CK may find the Castles and Crusade: Monsters and Treasure book by Troll Lord Games to be helpful in running the adventure.

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game Volume 2: \"U7 - Berlin\" is the next release continuing the successful product series \" World of Subways\" introducing famous subway lines around the world to all subway enthusiasts. After Vol. 1, Vol. 2 contains the route U7 of Berlin`s subway. It takes you from Spandau to Rudow and is therefore the longest of all Berlin`s subway routes. Route map With a coverage of 31.8 km (19,8 miles) and 40 stations the U7 is not only the longest of all Berlin subway lines but also the line with the most stations and the longest journey time. Built from 1924 to 1984 this large profile line runs completely underground, through a total of 5 districts of the German capital and even goes underneath the rivers Spree and Havel as well as the Teltow and the Westhafen canal. More of its history can be found here Features Here´s what you can expect from \"World of Subways Vol. 2: U7 - Berlin \" A feature list to be exited about. Animated display monitors at stations. Realistic shift service to schedule. Intelligent and custom announcements Passenger volume dependend on time if day. Simulation of wear and tear caused by style of operation (can be selected via options) Extensive scoring system, adding to the excitement and fun. Custom setting of destination display during operations. Customizable light settings on train (position lights, cab lighting, etc) Opening doors to be seen from either inside or outside, controlled by the player Doors can be openend seperately. Options are the doors on the right and left side of the train. Of course you can also open both sides at the same time. Train vibration – as soon as the train starts moving, vibrations will take effect on the train. Train swings – The train will start swinging the higher the speed. You will especially get this kind of feel in the cab. Hard braking will also produce this effect and the train will still be in a swinging motion when it has come to a full stop. Intelligent AI traffic operating to real schedules. Display on destination signs and announcements are controlled automatically. Configurable key commands – The player can freely configure keys to his liking. He can for instance configure the key for the brake lever wherever he wants. 3D – Cockpit with rotatable camera – allowing the player to look around. By using a key stroke the view angle will be centered again. Free movement inside the train – While the train is stationary at a station you will have the option to switch to an ego perspective inside the passenger car. You can move by using keyboard commands, view angles can be controlled with the mouse. Free movement on the station – you can get off the train at any station and move around (ego perspective). There will also be some missions starting on the platform of a station. The player will have to walk into to the train, into the cab which is seperated from the passenger area by a door. Free movement in the tunnels and on the track Changing of cabs – sometimes you will have to change the cabs during a mission. The train driver has to leave the cab, the train and then walk along the platform to the other end. He then gets into the train and cab again to prepare for departure. A brandnew mission module with new mission Flashlight for virtual walk in the tunnel Compatible with Raildriver Cab Controller Rolling Stock The U-7 line is a so called wide gauge line, carrying only wide gauge trains. The main difference to the narrow gauge line trains such as the U1, U2, U15, U3 and U4 line trains lies in the measurements of the carriages and the power supply. Gauge width though is the same on the narrow and wide gauge tracks (1435 millimeters).\"World of Subways Vol.2: U7 - Berlin\" features the wide gauge trains F 90 and the H 01. F 90: In 1974 the series F (F74) was being built and then further developed. The F90 was built from 1990 to 1991. The outline and constructual parts of the train are rather plain and simple compared to the modern H series. Nevertheless it shows the timeless elegance (if one can say so) of the 70´s and 80`s. These trains were built by ABB Henschel. H 01: The H 01 is one of the most modern vehicles of the Berlin Subway System. This wide gauge train has been built between 2000 and 2002. These trains were built by ABB Henschel, Adtranz, Bombardier. The H train is usually a set of 6 cars. This system allows a seamless transition between the cars of the trains resulting in 100 m long distance wher the passenger can walk through from end to end. Highlights Besides being the longest Berlin Subway route it has some more features which are worth mentioning. The underground route is really entertaining and exiting as is has many turns and gradients on offer. Just before the Mehringdamm/Gneisenaustr. crossroads for example it does a very hard left turn in a radius of not even 100 m, one of the most difficult turns in the Berlin Subway system. Impressive 2 level tunnel sections such as in the area of Mehringdamm and Jungfernheide, many chamber locks at the underground sections of the rivers and canals which close rapidly when water comes through, are another feature. The stations architechture holds a lot of varieties, here´s a description of two of them: First we´d like to mention the station Hermannplatz.. Being 7 m high, 132 m long and 22 m wide, its almost a cathedral. The first subway escalators were introduced here in 1926 with another highlight coming three years later. The year 1929 the department store Karstadt opened at Hermannplatz, at this time the most modern store in all of Europe. The Karstadt company paid part of the costs of building tis pompous station and in return got a direct entrance to its store. Even today still almost unique. When designing \"Zitadelle\", inspiration came purely from the nearby Spandau citadel, one of the most important medieval fortresses of Europe and one of the many touristical attractions of Berlin and the district of Spandau.

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content Partner Programme member Aerosoft brings the detailed and scenic Rhine Valley Railway between Freiburg and Basel to Train Simulator! Envisaged as an important route throughout the south of Germany and into Switzerland, the Rhine Valley Railway was funded in the late 1830s. The Baden State Railway knew they wanted to build a line between Mannheim and Basel, making it as straight as possible to keep both journey times and construction costs at a minimum, all while serving as many major cities as possible. The line subsequently followed the natural path already carved out by the Rhine, with construction lasting until 1855. The line opened in sections as each was completed, and the railway in full quickly became a key route for Germany and Switzerland. When first built, the line was actually 5ft 3in in gauge (Irish Gauge), before being converted to standard in the mid-1850s. Today, the line is one of the most important in Germany, ferrying local and international passenger and freight traffic, almost always operating at peak capacity. Two of Europe’s largest marshalling yards are present along the railway to host the level of freight traffic it gets. The route from Aerosoft is set around 2013/14 and covers the 60 km section between Freiburg (Germany) and Basel (Switzerland), including the newly built high-speed line, taking the route to over 80 km of expertly crafted railway which will be yours to explore. Combine that with 2 locomotives, the DB BR 111 and 189, plus the addition of the DB BR 401 ‘ICE 1’, you will soon have a package unlike any other, so keep an eye out for more on the Rhine Valley: Freiburg – Basel route, available now!

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content  Welcome to the Order of the Teutonic Knights, the elite military order of the Crusader army. Bring these elite warriors to battle for the Holy Land, recruit new allies, and follow the Grand Master into the labyrinth of intrigue and power. Face ghosts from the past, witness the might of holy miracles, and use Christian relics of great power to protect the war-torn Kingdom of Jerusalem!  Key Features:   New heroes and new units:   Heinrich von Bassenheim: The Teutonic order may be small, but they recruit extremely skilled warriors. The leader of the Teutonic Knights in the Holy Land is known as the Grand Master. He is a veteran of many battles, both on the field and in political skirmishes as well. Otokar von Marland: He is the Master of Arcane, a knight who possesses great knowledge in the mysterious arts that the commoners call magic. Otokar has lived a secluded life, and over his many years in the Holy Land he has hunted down rare arcane tomes, and visited many sages and wise men. Now, it is finally time for him to use this knowledge to protect his brothers in arms. Brothers of the Sword: These sacred warriors of the Order serve as bodyguards and elite warriors, having travelled to the Holy Land under the orders of the Grand Master. They receive unique training and are provided with the finest equipment. Teutonic Archers: Although these vassals will never enter the higher ranks of the Order, they nevertheless fight for their brethren with great spirit and dedication. Teutonic Infantry: These crusaders are the volunteer forces of the Teutonic Knights. They are neither vassals nor sworn knights. They may have lacked proper training when they joined the Order, but constant skirmishes on the Holy Lands quickly turn any soldier into an efficient warrior. Teutonic Lay Knights: These nobles hold land granted to them by the Order. Most of them hold lands in the Holy Roman Empire, which engenders in them a sense of brotherhood, borne out on the battlefield. Teutonic Mercenaries: The Order welcomes with open arms any mercenaries who enter the Holy Land and strengthen their forces. True, these mercenaries do not belong to the inner ranks of the Order, but they are provided with the finest equipment. The Brethren: They swore to protect the pilgrims of the Holy Land, and have founded hospitals for the sick. By their actions, they have made the Order of Teutonic Knights a respected presence in the Holy Land. Originally they only defended the ports of Acre, but as the conflict escalated, they have found themselves engaged in the larger conflict.  Numerous new abilities, spells, artifacts: Presence of the Grand Master, Holy Protection, Incineration, Inspire Zeal, Incantations of St. Alberic, Rosary of St. Gregorius, Sacred Goblet of St. Anthony, Shroud of St. Afan Four unique events of the Crusader Campaign add to the gameplay on Holy Land.

The company where my parents work has moved to another city, so we had to move as well. Right from the moment we moved in the new house, I started to hear some strange sounds, and after a few days I began feeling that there was someone else in the house, and when looking out of the window, it seemed that I could see somebody’s figure out there. It was a girl. And yesterday she left a present at our door. When I picked it up, she started following me. The next day, our neighbors told me that had been a girl who liked to come to that house and play hide-and-seek with those who lived there. Today my parents went to Mexico for a week, and I’m gonna have to spend seven days alone in our new house.',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game The Perfectionist is a game that allows for a lot of trial and error and offers plenty of freedom in deciding your fate. The slightest action or decision could ultimately change the story and ending. For example, the player can beat the game without freeing and recruiting any of the other party members but you'll most likely get a bad ending. However, if the player recruits more party members; new rooms, puzzles, side missions and bonuses may be unlocked but the difficulty of the game will overwhelmingly increase. As for the story you play as Dillan, a former thug who lived a life of crime on the streets. Him, along with numerous other criminals have been detained in a top secret research facility run by the twisted, Professor Phillips. He wants to better society and is on the verge of creating a chemical solution with many medicinal benefits. For his research, however, he needs human experiments and prefers using criminals as a form of justice. After years of torment and inhumane experimentation, Dillan manages to escape from his cell. The overly paranoid professor keeps everything locked in his facility, especially the front doors. To escape from Phillips' research facility, Dillan must collect 8 Code Pages in order to gain the access codes for the entrance doors. This however, will be no easy task. Danger lurks in every corner and room as security guards patrol the halls, security robots are on the hunt for you, and dangerous traps and puzzles await to hinder your mission. Venture through the cold and deadly halls alone, save other research experiments and have them aid in your escape, or even customize your own battle robot to help eliminate any threats that stand in your way! Can you escape from the facility? Features: 10 different endings Optional party members, either play the game solo or as a team Customizable robot character (upgrade stats and skills) Sneak passed enemies or trigger random encounters In-game achievements\",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content The third installment in the LoveKami series descends upon Steam! LoveKami -Healing Harem- is a visual novel set in the same universe as LoveKami -Divinity Stage- and LoveKami -Useless Goddess-. With a different setting to the previous two chapters, Healing Harem introduces us to the Tatarigami, known as Goddesses who spread misfortune. Set in a community deep within the mountains, Akira spends most of his time listening to the Goddess\\' troubles and helped them find solutions. \"I\\'ll find a solution to the Goddess\\' problems!\" The more things seem the same, the more they\\'re actually different... These are some strange little stories about Goddesses in love. They happened in a time when Goddesses and people lived in close proximity, six years after the Goddesses descended to Earth. Our story takes place in Kamimori City, a community deep in the mountains that is known among some people for one thing; the area is protected by a Tatarigami. Tatarigami are known for spreading misfortune, but Kamimori City is protected by one. Akira Manase has inherited a shrine in Kamimori City, and spent his days listening to the Goddess\\' troubles. One day, he helped one of the Tatarigami, Yukari, and she fell madly in love with him, almost immediately proposing marriage. \"Please make me your wife!\" However, there were Goddesses other than Yukari who were also in love with Akira, and they were intent on staking their claim. As the Goddesses vie for his hand in marriage, Akira spends his days helping them solve their problems. Characters Yukari Amatsu A Tatarigami who dropped out of the Divine Education Act. She enjoys physical contact with people and will come on pretty strongly, but always brings misfortune to the objects of her affection. Originally she was enshrined in the big city, but unable to face the feelings of terror she caused around her, she escaped to Kamimori City and met Akira. After scaring so many people she loved through her curse, her heart is deeply wounded. When Akira doesn\\'t fear her curse at all, she feels they are destined to be together, but her profound love creates a darkness when she sees Akira being tempted away from her by Shion and Kaede. She loves him so deeply it\\'s hard to control her feelings, and sometimes she acts a little scary. She\\'s obsessed with him and much of everything she does is focused around him somehow. She feels a little bad about insinuating herself into his life and trying to force him to act like newly-weds, but she just can\\'t hold back her joy at finding someone she feels destined to be with. Shion Misono The Goddess of misfortune who arrived in Kamimori City not long before Yukari. She\\'ll do anything she can, including helping out the elderly, for a price (usually vegetables or snacks). The elderly people in the area are pretty fond of her as a result, even if she is a Goddess of misfortune. She\\'s generally cheerful and positive, and doesn\\'t take a whole lot seriously, except for money. She pinches every single penny she can get her hands on. From the moment she set eyes on the main character she considered it a foregone conclusion they would be together and started making advances on him. This makes her a troublemaker, as she has no problem trying to seduce him in front of Yukari and Kaede. She blames the fact that she\\'s not as curvy as the other Goddesses on the fact that she\\'s the Goddess of misfortune, and therefore got shortchanged in that department too. Kaede Shizumori A former Tatarigami Goddess who descended to Earth following the Divine Education Act. Where she used to bring calamity to Kamimori City, now she is worshipped at the local shrine. Her love for Akira after meeting him only helps to cure her curse, and she is revered as a protectorate of the city. She\\'s calm and even-tempered now, and tries to not bring up her dark past as a wild Tatarigami. She\\'s voluptuous like a pin-up model. She doesn\\'t hide her affections for Akira, but gets shy about sexual matters. This makes her feel a little jealous about how easily Shion latches onto him or Yukari tries to consummate the marriage she imagines for them.',\n",

About SHOGUN: Total War™ Japan, 1542, a country in turmoil. The last shogunate has collapsed, leaving a nation divided into numerous factions, each led by a daimyo, a feudal warlord. Each daimyo is out to scheme, murder, and wage war to become supreme ruler. The emperor is powerless, a puppet of whichever faction controls Kyoto. Into this melting pot come the first European explorers; bringing guns, religion, and disease. Out of this chaos will emerge only one daimyo, he who will master all the varied skills that make up the art of war;  Politics, economics, subterfuge, strategic warfare, and battlefield tactics. Only one will become Shogun. •\\tThe first, original title in a 15 year series of award-winning strategy games. •\\tThe debut of the now legendary formula of Total War gameplay; a unique mix of turn-based grand strategy and real-time battles. •\\tZen-like simplicity belies a deep and rewarding game, even when measured against the best contemporary titles. •\\tNow updated for modern resolutions and Steam integration. About SHOGUN: Total War™ - Mongol Invasion Though in history, Kublai Khan’s otherwise unstoppable Mongol Horde were turned back from Japan’s shores by catastrophic weather, in this expansion for SHOGUN: Total War, the ultimate ‘what-if’ question of the period is asked. As either the invading Mongols or the ruling Hojo clan of Japan, it is up to you to take the islands for the Khan or secure your homeland against an imposing threat. •\\tFeatures a new playable faction, and new units on both sides of the conflict. •\\tAdds new campaign and multiplayer modes. •\\tIncludes a map editor to complete the challenge and further enhance a seminal title.',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content The commuter BR111 electric locomotive seen across Germany since the 1970s is now available for Train Simulator, with accompanying DBbzf Control Car and double decker passenger coaches. In the early 1970s, Deutsche Bahn’s demand for electric locomotives for passenger trains saw the development of the BR111, a successor to the Class 110 and built to accommodate faster speeds on passenger services.  A total of 227 models were built in the class between 1970 and 1982, with the first locomotive delivered in December 1974. Many of the class were put into service on S-Bahn services, although with ageing locomotive stock serving Intercity routes, some were fitted for Intercity services and operated across Germany. Each of the locomotive’s four axles were fitted with motors supplying 4,990hp (3,720 kW) and a top speed of 160km/h (99mph). The BR111 often operated in conjunction with a rear control car, giving push-pull capabilities on commuter services due to its ZWS remote control, operated from the locomotive. A third generation DBbzf control car is included with the BR111 for Train Simulator, alongside double-decker DBz and DAbz coaches. The BR111 for Train Simulator is available in two Deutsche Bahn liveries – Orient Red and Traffic Red - and features a DBbzf control car in mint turquoise and traffic red liveries, realistic wheel slip and sanding effects, SIFA driver vigilance device, PZB train protection system and double-decker coaches. The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the DB BR111 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Hamburg-Hanover route (available separately and required to play these scenarios). Scenarios Six scenarios for the Hamburg-Hanover route: Celle to Hannover Lueneburg to Celle Night Service RE Hannover to Celle RE to Lueneburg S Bahn to the Airport More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game. Train Simulator’s Steam Workshop scenarios are free and easy to download, adding many more hours of exciting gameplay. With scenarios being added daily, why don’t you check it out now!

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content  *NOTE* This pack is available in the in-game store under the Marketplace tab.  You are strongly recommended to find the product there and make your purchase from within the game. In order to be able to use this add-on livery product, you MUST first own the GP20 Southern Pacific add-on.  If you check in the in-game store it will verify if you own it before you purchase. The second generation EMD GP20 ushered in a new era of turbocharged locomotives on American railroads, and now this 2,000hp heavy freight hauler is available for Train Simulator in Union Pacific livery. The EMD GP20 was seen as leading the way in a new age of turbocharged diesel locomotives, even though some of EMD’s competitors had been experimenting with higher horsepower models several years earlier. In reality, the GP20 only offered a small increase in horsepower over its predecessor, the GP18, but EMD’s salesmen touted the locomotive’s ability to reduce consist sizes and maintenance costs, and increase speeds to secure sales. GP20s could be identified ahead of similar GP7, GP9 and GP18 models by an additional small radiator fan ahead of its large aft fan, the prominent bulge behind the cab which housed its turbocharger, and a single large exhaust stack. The EMD GP20 for Train Simulator, developed by Reppo, is available in Union Pacific livery and features a highly detailed cab interior with operating switches, advanced and standard driving controls, realistic engine start up procedure, accurately modelled simulation, engine overheating and working unit selector. The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the EMD GP20 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. You must own the GP20 Southern Pacific before you will be able to use this add-on ',\n",

His death was inevitable, but was saved by the crew of a small submarine, which happened to be nearby. The rescued one was brought to the secret base of AQUATICA - people with implanted shark gills, which allowed them to breathe freely under water. He was asked to become a member of the underwater fraternity, agreeing to a surgery transplanting of the gills. Otherwise, an unenviable fate awaited him... Key Features: Discover underwater base in the deep sea, meeting all of its strange inhabitants, friends and foes alike. Learn the history of the underwater fraternity and unveil the truth. Look for clues to break out of this scrape. In the course of their search, you will face madness, meanness, betrayal and unexpected outcomes. But even in the most difficult moments, when it begins to seem that this world can no longer give anything to its inhabitants, do not despair and go towards the goal. Fight for your life with melee and ranged weapons in the real-time. Or look for a way to negotiate. And single player only, like a nice RPG should be. Demo: We have a free demo version of the game.

However, this delivery wasn’t meant for you. Will you fall in love with the person he turns out to be? Will you be able to keep him by your side?

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game  Infamous vampire Remilia Scarlet has grown weary of her posh, centuries-long life spent with dutiful maid Sakuya Izayoi at her side. So bored, in fact, that when the local newspaper runs a story about a massive monster spotted nearby, she decides she wants a piece of that action! Unfortunately, she returns home from her first foray to find her mansion heavily damaged, with no clues as to who the culprit might be. But this only serves to fan the flames of the vampiric maiden’s interest in what’s going on beyond the walls of her estate, leading her on a grand, chaotic quest for answers…and for revenge. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The enchanting world of the Touhou Project comes alive in this beautiful fan-made action RPG! Key Features Select Either of Two Playable Characters for Twice the Adventure Choose to play as the titular vampire, Remilia Scarlet, or her devoted maid, Sakuya Izayoi. Each offers a different gameplay style with unique mechanics: Remilia’s attacks hit hard, while Sakuya’s are more technical. Use Five Buttons to Carve Out Countless Swaths of Destruction The game’s controls are simple, fun, and endlessly customizable: you’ll learn a variety of skills as you level up, which you can assign to the game’s action buttons however you’d like. Build Hit Combos for Greater Success in Battle The more you’re able to hit enemies in rapid succession, the higher your attack power will be, and the more experience you’ll receive per kill. The effect will wear off over time, however, or when you’re struck by a foe – whichever comes first! Collect New Equipment to Become a True Powerhouse Each new piece of equipment you find has its own stats, to the point that even two items with the same name may sport notable variances. So collect all the equipment you can, and try to max out your arsenal! There may even be rare equipment out there that allows you to utilize entirely new skills… Get In the Zone With Arranged BGM from Acclaimed Doujin Circle Hachimitsu-Lemon Let a total of 35 background music tracks masterfully arranged from previous Touhou titles wash over you as you experience the breakneck action! Brand New Steam Features Revised Difficulty Levels From the Console Version Tweaked and adjusted, the game should now better suit any and all difficulty preferences, from the most casual action gamer to the most hardcore shmupaholic! Fully-Featured Configuration Menu for PC Gamers Includes the ability to remap and rebind keys and gamepad buttons, adjust technical specs and graphic levels, and more, allowing for a custom experience perfectly suited to your individual machine as well as your personal tastes. 4K Resolution Support For a truly immersive action gaming experience! Brand New “Bullet Hell” Mode Start the game in this mode to drastically increase the quantity and intensity of enemy projectiles. You are not prepared! New Achievements and the Full Steamworks Package Try to 100% the game…if you dare!',\n",

With that in mind, levels in this game only have meaning in learning new skills as you level up allowing you to create more diverse strategies for enemies who also get stronger along with you. These same diverse strategies help when facing bosses which can modify the battle field to provide extreme elemental advantage in their favor so be careful not to forego the leveling aspect of the game! PSI Magic also caters to those who simply wish to explore the game world by having hidden maps, bosses, collectibles, treasure and a mercenary system. If the player achieves certain criteria, they may even discover a hidden after boss beyond the final boss of the game! Custom music tracks have been created to provide a novel experience along your journey throughout the game world in addition to the creation and use of custom assets to alleviate some of the eye sore that comes from over use of the base assets that come with the game engine. The story focuses on the esper pair, Abell and Ceres, who, after a confrontation with a mysterious group, ended up in another world. In this world, the pair are joined by two others who then go on to face off against this group and put a stop to its grand-fully reckless scheme!

Depending on the choice of character, and behavior, new opportunities and series of quests will come up. Living on a ship, players will experience a broad variety of RPG quests. There will be two new character archetypes to play, tons of new foes and monsters as well as equipment items.

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game Reentry is a space flight simulator based on real life spacecrafts. You create a new astronaut, gain levels and experience for every move you make by completing missions in space. You will have access to missions similar to what happened in real life, or fictional missions designed to challenge you as an astronaut.  Spacecrafts are highly complicated machines with the primary task of exploring and understanding what's outside the atmosphere of Earth, while keeping the astronauts alive for long periods. This is achieved by hundreds of individual systems and backup systems working together. With the help from the in-game Space Flight Academy, the provided flight manual for each spacecraft, and checklists, you will learn how to fly and operate these machines, and explore space in a high resolution and realistic environment.  Control almost every system like the real astronauts, see the sunset and sunrise while orbiting orbiting Earth with speeds exceeding 25,500 ft/s. Explore the surface of Earth and the Moon with high resolution textures, or simply enjoy the solitude of being in space.  Imagine the final few seconds before launching into space. You are sitting on top of a 111 meter high rocket, looking at the instruments of a spaceship about to leave the oasis we call Earth. The engines are igniting, mechanical systems are clinging below you, while thousands of gallons of fuel is pumping through the systems. The loud roar of the five F1 engines are producing close to 8,000,000 pounds of thrust, violently shaking the cockpit and lifting 3 million kg off the pad. The launch pad tower is slowly moving away from you while the engines are balancing the rocket like a skyscraper on a needle. Sophisticated engineers has created the systems that will safely accelerate you to 25,500 ft/s, into a free fall orbit, with the Moon as the destination.  Welcome to Reentry, an orbital simulator.\",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content The DB BR 101 is a classic among the modern electric locomotives of Germany, with heritage spanning some of the nation’s most revolutionary designs and continuing the honour by working throughout the Deutsche Bahn network every day. Partner Programme Developer Virtual Railroads brings this classic locomotive to life in a true expert simulation of the class as it joins the Pro Range line-up for Train Simulator. In the early 1990s, a majority of Germany’s express passenger services were undertaken by locomotives that date back to the 1970s including the DB BR 103 and DB BR 120. Both once-revolutionary locomotives had more than outlived their purpose where they were now hauling heavier trains than they had ever been designed for, this resulted in a lot of damage over time with increasingly poor reliability rates and maintenance costs. Germany was in desperate need of a new express passenger locomotive. Following the reunification of Germany, the newly formed Deutsche Bahn AG (DBAG) went on the lookout for designs, with many manufacturing companies bidding for the deal. There were over 30 designs in the second phase of bidding some of which were quickly eliminated, in particular the non-German manufacturers. One company in particular, ABB Henschel, didn’t even have a design ready to show, but more of a concept known as the eco2001. The eco2001 was basically 2 modified DB BR 120s, with changes to various components that massively increases the reliability of the locomotives. In 1994, DB signed a deal with ABB which would develop into an order of 145 locomotives the following year, with the first locomotive completed and displayed in the Orient Red livery by July 1996. Around this time, ABB had merged with AEG to form ADtranz, this was beneficial because it meant the future DB BR 101s would be built quicker in multiple locations. Different components were built at a variety of facilities, with the final assembly taking place in Poland. The first DB BR 101 officially entered service in February 1997. The DB BR 101 was designed and procured to be an efficient, high speed passenger locomotive and is capable of achieving this in part due to the carefully structured sloped front and rear of the locos. This slope may look extreme in places, but it optimises streamlined efficiency to its maximum especially when compared to its cost-effectiveness. The slope is also designed not to disrupt the flow of air between the rear of the locomotive and whatever it may be hauling. The DB BR 101 was also designed with bogies derived from the ICE series, as a basis for potential speed modifications in the future, as fast as 250 km/h. All 145 locomotives were completed by 1999 and entered service hauling express passenger services across the Deutsche Bahn network including the likes of the Nuremberg – Munich High Speed Line where the 101s operate the fastest regional service in Germany at 200 km/h. All the DB BR 101s are based in Hamburg where they receive their periodic safety checks and maintenance, they were originally based in Frankfurt, but with the rapid increase of the various ICE series’ and push-pull operated consists, they were moved to Hamburg despite the amount of driver training that would require, the 101s sometimes visit Nuremburg for major maintenance works. The basis of the DB BR 101 has its roots in some of the most ground breaking electric locomotives, so much so it shares a lot of heritage with the popular TRAXX series of locomotives and a variation of the DB BR 101 was ordered for a most unlikely customer, New Jersey Transit, which in the early 2000s worked with ADtranz/Bombardier to procure their ALP-46 and ALP-46A locomotives.

Each player has three tiles in a hand and takes turns placing them, capturing other adjacent tiles based on the tile’s facing value. Not only are the values of your tiles important but also their position on the game board. The goal is to capture your opponent’s tiles and control the majority of the board when all spaces are filled.  -          Easy to Learn, Hard to Master: When a tile is captured it rotates, changing which numbers are facing which side. In this way you can try to block or manipulate your opponent’s moves.   -          Cascading Captures: Enemy tiles adjacent to your captured tiles can also be captured, continuing on and on.  Place your tile wisely and watch as you flip half your enemy’s tiles!   -          Elemental Attributes: Some tiles have elemental gems that alter the values of enemy tiles around them.  There are five elements and learning to use them could be the key to victory!',\n",

Major Afshar has been tasked with finding those responsible. Meanwhile, some 3,300 miles away in London, an Iranian journalist is handed documents that uncover a conspiracy of seismic proportions. As both the Major and the journalist delve deeper, their paths will cross, plans for a coup will be uncovered and Western government involvement will be exposed. Dark Years is an action-adventure game based on the real events surrounding ‘Operation Ajax ‘. In an attempt to secure the rights to Iran’s oil, the British and American governments secretly backed a coup that over-threw the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh. The result was a period of great instability and violence.

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game  Comet Crasher is a fast-paced platformer where you soar down an endless tunnel, while sowing as much chaos as you possibly can. The further you fall without standing still, the faster your points rack up. But there's a catch: the more speed you build, the faster the game moves and the harder the ball becomes to control. Key Features Easy to pick up, hard to master. Use the terrain and even your own bullets to manage your speed. Built for replayability. With procedurally generated levels, quick sessions and score-attack style gameplay, this feels like a true arcade. Crazy powerups to help you on the way down. From big lasers to triple shots and ridiculously fast rapid-fire, it's all there. Mix powerups together for even crazier effects. That laser with rapid-fire added on does exactly what you think it does. Compete on an online worldwide leaderboard. Beat your friends (and the rest of the world, while you're at it) to the top of the list. Did I mention explosions? Ludum Dare 40 This game was originally an entry for the 40th Ludum Dare game jam, where it was rated the 32nd most fun game of all 2890 submissions! Since then, tons of polish and new features have been added.\",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content Deep Sky Derelicts: New Prospects, the first expansion to Deep Sky Derelicts, introduces a number of remarkable upgrades and new features, opening up exciting new prospects for the scavengers roaming the DSD world.  Making planetfall, getting lost in blizzards and sandstorms, engaging with scavenger colonies and clearing out monster lairs – not only does the New Prospects expansion give a hefty boost to the variety of scenery and diversity of encounters out there, it also makes exploration even more exciting, tense and suspenseful than ever before. Get ready to have the risk-reward trade-off honed to a knife edge...  To help you cope with all these previously unseen perils, though, we’ve greatly reinforced you with many new and enhanced tools and possibilities, right at your fingertips. These include sneaking, ambushing enemies, remote scanning, en-route medical treatment, environmentally-mediated combat actions, and even an entirely new class – the Miner. Life has never been as difficult or exciting as now! New exploration mechanics: Stealth, Rush and Normal exploration stances now allow you to sneak past enemies or ambush them, or simply conserve energy and proceed as usual. Field treatment helps restore wounded squaddies’ health and temporarily boost your card draw when away from home. A wide range of new environmental conditions: Global conditions (derelict-wide): dynamic gravity, plague ship, radiation waves and more. New local conditions, including hazardous planetary conditions, such as blizzards and sandstorms. Other defining conditions such as Ghost Ship (derelicts full of stealthy, dangerous enemies), and Tourist Trap (more loot, more dead scavengers...). Wider universe to be discovered: New locations to visit apart from the derelicts: ice and desert planets. Settlements: confined, guarded areas that belong to various factions, such as scavenger colonies, pirate forts and scourge nests. These can all be interacted with in multiple ways, for example by taking contracts, trading or pillaging. Additional class - the Miner and new enemies: 10 new enemies, including deadly new variations on the Cobra and Skink, as well as the brand-new Dreadwurm, Stone Shepherds and Myrmexes. New character class – the Miner. Custom look, ability tree and exclusive new heavy ranged weapon, the Blaster, plus extension mods and new cards! New equipment and missions: New equipment offering exciting new options for gearing up your scavengers, such as regenerating shield cores, as well as illustrious new mods to make them fully shine. A dozen compelling new missions to accomplish, on planet surfaces and inside derelicts. Numerous UI updates and improvements: Stance selector button on the scanner screen. Minor and major ship condition info on the star map screen. ',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content After two years of lightning victories all across northern Europe, the German army has suffered its first major setback in the war. The great offensive to the east - the invasion of the Soviet Union - has stalled right in front of the gates of Moscow. Following the relentless defense of their capital city, the Soviets have launched several major counter-attacks during the harsh winter of 1941. German forces are forced to retreat and regroup, but must maintain their position in reach of Moscow. Once the Soviet attacks have been broken and the strength of the Panzer Divisions is replenished the offensive will resume - until total victory has been achieved.  Panzerkrieg , the new expansion for Order of Battle - WW2 forms the second part of the German Grand Campaign, following the previously released Blitzkrieg DLC. Players can start the Panzerkrieg campaign from scratch, or import their core force from the end of the Blitzkrieg campaign - including all the previously unlocked commanders and specializations. The campaign focuses exclusively on the Eastern Front, including iconic battles such as the Siege of Sevastopol, the devastating urban warfare at Stalingrad and the epic clash of armour at the battle of Kursk. Features • 40+ new units , including Tiger and Panther tanks, Ferdinand tank-destroyers and Wurfrahmen motorized rocket launchers, while the Luftwaffe has been reinforced with new aircraft such as the Fw 190 series, Me 410 fighter-bombers and Ju 87 G \"kanonenvogels\". • Designed to be played as a grand campaign, following the Blitzkrieg campaign and preceding a yet unannounced final chapter in the German European campaign. Core force importing has been improved and expanded to include previously unlocked commanders and specializations. • A new wet climate type affects the battlefield: units move slower in the mud and dirt roads no longer provide any movement bonuses. Scenarios • Rhzev • Demyansk • Kharkov • Sevastopol • Voronezh • Kalach • Caucasus • Stalingrad • Winterstorm • Zvesda • Kharkov • Kursk',\n",

He will revisit and attempt to escape from locations connected to his past and along the way uncover the mysteries behind his forgotten past. “I regained consciousness in what seemed to be some kind of detention facility. With a lot of difficulty, I made it out of the hall only to appear in my own home, the home I shared together with Jess. She spoke to me in such a way that she didn’t know about the strange situation I was finding myself in. She spoke to me so ordinarily as if everything was alright. No, something about it was a little off. She told me not to follow her but even as I tried, I found myself between two high-rise buildings with a narrow bridge connecting the two. Fear suddenly gripped me. Not because I found myself having to cross a tightrope between two buildings. But it was an ominous feeling that I might lose her. Finally, at the end of a dark hallway, I see my wife once again. What’s the dreaded meaning of this game of hide and seek? And what are these absurd locations and experiences? These things that I seeing and hearing, Is it reality or just a dream? I have to figure out what’s going on.” Gameplay: Trespass – Episode 2 is a game intended to test your cognitive abilities. Escape from various locations, all of which have unique objectives whether it’s searching for hints in a morgue through interacting with the surrounding objects or making your way through a military facility using various weapons and explosives. Everything you need to escape is there. It’s all a matter of using your observational skills and thinking outside of the box.',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game As a lone Soviet Cosmonaut, you are sent to investigate a communication blackout aboard a Russian space station. You arrive to find the station in disrepair and the crew missing. You must uncover the fate of these lost souls, trapped between the claustrophobia of the station and the vast, unforgiving openness of space. Outreach is an historical fiction set in the 1980s, blurring the line between fact and conspiracy theory. The narrative is told from the Soviet perspective, focusing on the details that highlighted the humanity in a conflict so often marked by division and statistics. In order to capture such an authentic atmosphere, our artists have spent months researching the era. The environments, technology, and clothing have all been lovingly crafted and expanded from historical designs, photos, and archive footage. The dangers and isolation present in the narrative of Outreach are reflected in the movement system, as Outreach takes place entirely in zero-gravity. Push yourself off, time your landings, and grapple for handrails on the exterior of the station. Inside the station, move through confined environments on your search for clues. Your coordination and reflexes are the only protection you have from the void. Game Features Interact: Uncover the true nature of an era-accurate space station, constructed from historical references. Inspect: Explore the environment with a realistic representation of zero gravity; Travel with no propulsion but by pushing yourself off from surfaces. Report: Discover the lives and motivations of the station crew, ground control and military personnel involved in Operation Outreach. ',\n",

Will you be agreedy trader, an ambitious fleet pilot or a ruthless pirate? Board enemy ships, manage factories, conquer star systems and forge your own galactic empire - ultimately, your actions will have an impact on a galactic scale. This downloadable content (DLC) is a compilation of background stories for the stand-alone expansion of the indie game\"Smugglers 5: Invasion\" and is named after the first of three background stories (mini-quests). Upon installation, the player can choose to play as a Jalkath warrior in one of the first two short but dynamic and multiple-pathed background stories, which will lead the player through the game. A third story is included, adding a short preview of the upcoming \"Aftermath\" spin-off storyline. While the Aftermath preview story can be played as a member of the Federation faction, the two background stories are exclusively for the new Jalkath faction. The first story, \"Warrior Within\" , sees you starting as a young warrior cadet. In the final challenge of your training, your ship is ordered to fight to the death against one of your fellow cadets. Your opponent\\'s engines were crippled, you had the upper hand... and you hesitated. You asked the forbidden question - why? The shame of your defeat makes you an outcast, on a journey to discover the foremost principles of Jalkath mythology - the \"way of the warrior\" - and ultimately play a decisive role in a coup. The second story, \"The Golden Claw\" , is about the legendary holy talisman of the First Warrior. A gift from the Warrior Gods, it is said to bestow great courage and good fortune on the one who wields it. In your quest to find the \"Golden Claw\" you will be challenged to question the beliefs of your people and will finally have the chance to unite the Jalkath under the new and only true emperor - yourself. In the third story, \"Aftermath preview\" , which is started automatically, you will receive a playable mini-quest (\"First Contact\"), a sneak preview of what to expect in the future storyline of the Smugglers universe. This mini-story was also available as a separate DLC for those who bought direct from the developer´s website.',\n",

Gird on your sword, don your armour, summon your followers and ride forth to win glory on the battlefields of Calradia. Establish your hegemony and create a new world out of the ashes of the old.

Experience epic, sprawling combat across ramparts and rubble as you desperately hold on to your castle or seek to seize one from the enemy. Historically authentic defensive structures offer the ultimate medieval warfare experience, as you batter a rival's gate with your ram or burn his siege tower to ashes.\\xa0Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord lets you live every moment of a chaotic battle through the eyes of a single soldier. DIPLOMACY Engage in diplomacy, with meaningful consequences that impact the world. Strike historic peace deals that win land for your kingdom or free you to take on a new foe.

Use a new influence system to direct your faction's energies or strangle the aspirations of a rival. SANDBOX ECONOMY See the availability of goods ebb and flow in a simulated feudal economy, where the price of everything from incense to warhorses fluctuates with supply and demand.

CRAFTING Craft your own weapon, name it and carry it with you to the field of battle! A deep, physics-based system gives each weapon you create a unique set of attributes, strengths and weaknesses. Forge a finely-tuned killing machine to match your own prowess and complement your play-style, or take the sword of your enemy and brandish it as a trophy of war.

Virtual idols look like normal humans, but they’re made of wire and circuitry. They can sing better, dance better, and entertain better than any human could ever hope to, and their devotion to their jobs is unfailing. The protagonist, Hana, is a young high school student who loves virtual idols - particularly Aiko. Aiko is the postergirl of the famous company Lyriq, and one of the most popular virtual idols to ever exist. Aiko is the nation’s darling, and though Hana adores her, she knows she’ll never get a chance to speak to her. Aiko is simply too far out of her reach. That is, until one day, when somebody claiming to be Aiko starts sending Hana text messages asking for help. Aiko tells Hana that she’s in severe danger of malfunctioning, and the only person who can save her is her original programmer… but nobody seems to know where they are, and nobody is willing to help her. Left with no alternatives, it’s up to Hana (and an eclectic cast of characters she meets along the way) to save Aiko from being turned into scrap metal! A sweet, family-friendly story about making friends, going on adventures, and the power of music! Written by ebi-hime, the author of Strawberry Vinegar and Blackberry Honey A large cast of adorable characters drawn by Melowbee, the artist behind Windswept Night A custom soundtrack by Mock Off, featuring insert songs by Vocaloid composer Kenji-B Numerous choices, branching endings, and character-specific epilogues to obtain In-game music and CG gallery Lots of cute girls (and some cute boys)!!!

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game  Brief Summary Operation Sheep Defense is a tower defense game. Your mission is to protect sheep from enemies. The enemy will try to capture these sheep. Fight off the enemy with defensive turrets. Unique Game Mechanics Each level takes around 6 minutes. Progression is fast and there are no boring moments. The number of enemy units can be huge, later levels can have over 3000 units that enter the level in under 6 minutes. Levels are dynamic, the enemy will use bulldozers to create new roads. Enemy behaviour is not scripted, every unit and bullets is simulated. Gameplay You will need every tactic you can think of, because the enemy can be very intelligent! Instead of simply choosing the shortest path, they will try to avoid towers. They will even build new roads using bulldozers. Every level will require a different approach. The game has over 80 balanced levels. Levels vary from large open areas, levels with multiple entrances, mazes and small fast paced levels. Place your towers at tactical positions in each level. In open areas you can shape the path that the enemy will have to take to get to the sheep. Upgrade towers to make them stronger. If a sheep has been captured, the enemy has to escape with the sheep. You still have some time to take the enemy down. There are seven different towers you can build. Each tower has its own strengths and weaknesses. Build small cannons for early defense. Small cannons are cheap to build but not very effective. Build the gattling gun to fight off stronger enemies. The gattling gun is more effective against all kinds of enemies. The rocket launcher does great damage to larger units and bosses. The fastest enemies can be stopped best using the laser tower. To make all towers more effective, use the slowdown tower to stall enemies. The flame thrower can be used against large enemy groups. Finally, you can use the big gun, which is slow but incredibly powerful and can target almost the entire map. Multiplayer There is local multiplayer which you can play on a single screen or tv. Play the entire campaign in coop mode, or play one of the coop missions. Many levels are adjusted and rebalanced for coop mode. For controls, choose between mouse, keyboard or any connected gamepad. The economy can be shared, individual or reversed between players. Features * Campaign with 80+ Levels * Local Multiplayer Coop * Level Challanges * Level Editor * Advanced AI * Gamepad support * Long Range Weapons * Pause and Fast Forward * 7 Upgradable Towers * 9 Sheep Are you as the commander ready to take on this challenge?',\n",

Violence: The act of the player using weapons of all kinds against aliens which usually have different results.  Gore: While it should be noted that the gore IS in a cartoon style and should by no means look realistic- You can expect to see the enemy aliens either: Simply become a corpse and fall to the floor, the same thing while also having several limbs dismembering in the process, or just simply exploding with all limbs separating from the corpse.

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game  Our hero, the titular Shocktopus, is out for revenge against the Magnetic Yeti. Its a dangerous world, but our little Cephalopod has a trick up one of his eight sleeves: he can change his electric charge at will . Zoom across electric fields, twist through magnets, and use conductors to bend the world to your will. Never has the Right Hand Rule involved so many tentacles!\\u200b The game is based on the actual physics of Electromagnetism -- which means you'll be an expert in the topic by the end.  Or, well, you'll have beaten a game.  And isn't that enough? This game has a Level Editor, and as the developer of the game, I see it as my duty to prove I can beat any level players throw my way.  So roughly each week, I load up a level and record myself trying to beat it.  You can watch my suffering (and joy) in the Feel Bad Friday video series!   Accurate Physics from a pedant you can trust  Electric charges that attract and repel you  Magnetic fields that cause you to spin according to Lorentz Forces  Conductors that warp electric fields, calculated using the Relaxation Method  Electric currents that lead to magnetic fields, via the Biot-Savart Law  44 Levels of fun! Plus one level of pure torture.  A Level Editor so you can make all your own levels, or do your own physics experiments.  A whole bunch of spikes and missiles.  The game comes with a virtual Voltmeter and electric field meter.  One more opportunity not to learn the Right Hand Rule!  Made by TestTubeGames, or more specifically me, Andy Hall. I run an indie game studio that's devoted to making fun, interactive science experiences.  Special Relativity, Particle Physics,  Gravity, you name it, I'm interested! Music was created by Brian Allen Holmes, and SFX were made by Kevin Notar.\",\n",

In this game you have to explore and interact to find out how to get out of the time loop. You are open to do anything you want, kill innocent people, go to work, watch tv, go to the park, etc.  There is no surprise that this game is inspired by the movie Groundhog Day.  The game takes place in a regular suburban town, powered by a nuclear plant, but after an accident in the power plant you get stuck in a temporal loop.  Your main goal is to find a way to break the time loop by exploring the world and to find out the secret behind all of this. If you die, you just wake up in your bed and the day starts again, so the world is your oyster. When you wake up you still know the information from the previous day and this influences the dialogue choices. Be a ruthless killer or become the friendliest neighbor to have ever walked the earth. Nothing matters when you're stuck in the same day for eternity... But maybe there's a way out.\",\n",

Meanwhile, hundreds of monsters are roaming inside, guarding the sword shards — the last known thing to be capable of defeating the demonic castle owner, thus shattering its magical structure. Although, you are not alone — some help could be obtained from the merchants, who, for reasons not truly understood, offer their services right inside the lair of evil. Though, it seems to be only a matter of time for them to disappear... Explore 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 rooms of randomly generated hazards and enemies while collecting the necessary artefacts. Plan your next step carefully, because save points aren't a thing in a rogue-lite game! There is, however, another option, explained below. FEATURES Battle System: Every character is different, try them all! Perform the Agile attack when you're in a pinch. Use armor and shields to your advantage and boost armor stats using the emblems. PAL/NTSC modes: If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch. Password System: Just like in an old NES game, in this game you need to input 13 characters to get back to your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything much more than the artefacts you've found... Unfold the mystery: Defeat minibosses to unlock more playable characters. CREDITS Game by D. E.

Brawl with your friends and train to become the top Rumble Fighter!  Story  A long time ago, the Dark Lord broke the peace treaty with the Gods, and commanded his dark forces to conquer the unsuspecting Rumble Fighter world. The vulnerable Rumble Fighter world was almost immediately taken over by the dark forces. When all hope was lost, a miracle happened! Powerful heroes chosen by the Gods arrived to defend against the dark forces.  The raging battle between the dark forces and heroes went on for so long that it seemed like it would never end. However, the heroes prevailed and finally sealed the Dark Lord. Peace would finally return to the Rumble Fighter world.  However, the great heroes did not have time to enjoy the peace. Dark forces that scattered after the battle are actively attempting to break the seal and rescue the Dark Lord. Thus, the heroes are still out there fighting for the Rumble Fighter world.  The heroes united together under an association called \"Guardians.\" Every member dedicates each day to training and hunting for dark forces.',\n",

In front of him is \"Sovyonok\" - a pioneer camp, behind him is his former life. To understand what happened to him, Semyon will have to get to know the local inhabitants (and maybe even find love), find his way in the complex labyrinth of human relationships and his own problems and solve the camp\\'s mysteries.

Since the release of the first version of the operating system 5 years have passed. This product was noticed and was purchased by a larger company engaged in the development of military robotics. For 5 years the best specialists were engaged in the improvement of this operating system now the system has been lapped to the ideal, the development team starts the first test of the updated system of AJ 2.1 in case of success, the company will launch large-scale production of the world's first full-fledged Android on the basis of this operating system. You have to go through 13 levels for efficacy checks and identify problems in the system of neural network AJ 2.1 You don't have any limitations to the approach and solving puzzles. You are given full control over the neural networks. In the modern world the current trend is interactive learning. This game will help you better learn the basics of programming without spending much time and money by learning through the visual system in the quests. The game contains 13 levels, each of which accommodates 1-3 scripts on the gaming scene. With each passed level the game is integrated into a complex puzzle, which demonstrates the various functions and variables within scripts. The gameplay encourages interaction, exploration, teaches a method of trial and error. A good game leaves the player with time to develop his skills, the same thing happens in the learning process. Naturally, to understand the scripts you'll need to explore the library of functions. Through these actions the player will learn new tools and discover his own abilities to programming. The very visual programming does not require the initial preparation for the game, the quests themselves teach a player, allowing him to understand the basic principles of programming. All that is required for the player is logic, which helps training and completing levels. In the game there is also a sandbox, you can use it for implementation of your different ideas, or just for practice or study. There will be enough tools in the library for implementation practically any of your ideas, and what is the most important, the implementation of different logics in the sandbox due to visual programming goes free and easy as the context dependence solves problems with syntax errors, however before passing into the sandbox we recommend you to pass the storyline in order to understand how the system of visual scripting works.\",\n",

This pack includes the following items: - 7 DAYS OF DOFUS SUBSCRIPTION: Enjoy all DOFUS has to offer for a week - RATCHAM PET: Ratchams are often mistaken for rats, due to their tail, long ears and lack of bodily hair. But if you adopt one, you'll soon find out how little this pawed predator has in common with a rodent. As cuddly as they come, it'll lick your face, and you'll discover that no, Ratchams are not completely lacking in hair. They feed off Ecaflee souls living in the Ecaflipus dimension, their favourite area. - LUMINO SIDEKICK (HEALING): If you take it upon yourself to restore lost harmony and re-establish order in the Krosmoz, you'd better hope you've got the charisma to pull it off!

Why would one devote their life to a King or a Princess that ultimately has no emotional bearing to their lives? What is honor, and what is devotion? What does it mean to be patriotic? A 14-year-old successor to the title of Royal Guardian struggles with these questions. Playing through fault - milestone one and milestone two side:above is advised, but not required. ',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content A drive to replace ageing, costly diesel locomotives across Europe has seen a number of new generation diesel fleets enter service in recent years, including the advanced ER20 Eurorunner, now available for Train Simulator in the eye-catching MRCE black gloss livery. The ER20 ‘Hercules’ is considered to be one of the quietest and most efficient diesel locomotives currently operating in Europe, having been manufactured with up-to-date diesel engine technology and innovative sound insulation, alongside low exhaust emissions. The locomotive is also relatively unique in design, being made of as few parts as possible in a modular construction method, which makes construction and maintenance more efficient. Built by Siemens over a ten year period from 2002, the ER20 was designed to replace older freight locomotive types with lower cost maintenance and emissions. They have proved to be a popular class of locomotive, although their low production numbers – less than 100 – is only such due to the widespread electrification of Europe’s rail network reducing the need for large diesel locomotive fleets. Customers in Germany, Austria, Lithuania and Hong Kong placed orders for the ER20 Eurorunner for both freight and passenger operations, including MRCE, a freight locomotive leasing company who took ownership of 15 models. This fleet of black gloss liveried locomotives can be seen today hauling multimodal freight traffic across Germany and into neighbouring European countries. The ER20 Eurorunner for Train Simulator recreates the locomotive in the striking MRCE black gloss livery and features SIFA and PZB signalling and cab control systems, centre sprung throttle and brake controls, and accompanying Zags and Shimms freight wagons. The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the MRCE ER20 Eurorunner on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Hamburg-Hanover route (available separately and required to play these scenarios). Scenarios Three scenarios for the Hamburg-Hanover route: Haul in Good Time Freight to Unterlüẞ Helping Hands More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game. Train Simulator’s Steam Workshop scenarios are free and easy to download, adding many more hours of exciting gameplay. With scenarios being added daily, why don’t you check it out now!

In the midst of an RPG, he was teleported to a castle. At first, Daniel believed that he was having a massive hallucination. Eager to keep playing within the RPG to create his own adventure, he decides to go along for te ride until his delirium comes to an end. Once inside the castle, Daniel is inhabited by a mysterious shadow.  This dark spirit can communicate with Daniel, but not control him. The shadow has a simple goal: to escape from the prison of Daniel's body. There's a catch, though-- the dark spirit can only escape if Daniel perishes. Struggling against enemies in the castle, with the dark spirit attempting to murder him at every turn. Daniel finally discovers his goal: to kill Harnakon, the master of the castle, and free the Pure-Spirits who are trapped within. While the stage seems set for a typical role-playing adventure, Daniel will soon discover that everything is not what it seems...

Experience the new world, capture wild spirits, and put together a team of ghosts to help you battle the forces of evil. Features Build Your Team - As a Ghostlord, you can capture ghosts to help you fight. Each type of ghost has different strengths and weaknesses - you'll have to think carefully to build a well balanced team. Turn-based Combat - Ghosts have four abilities, with a variety of different effects. Will you go all in with powerful attacks that will leave your ghost drained of energy? Or will you play the long game, taking advantage of status effects and stat boosts? Multiple Campaigns - There are many heroes in Ghostlords, with their own quests to complete and challenges to overcome. Can you help all of them? Mod Support - All the content in Ghostlords is accessible to modders, making it easy to tweak things or even to add new content. You can create new ghosts, characters, quests, encounters, environments, and even brand new campaigns. Catch Them All - There are more than fifty different kinds of ghost for you to find in the world. Catching a ghost permanently unlocks it for subsequent playthroughs. Can you catch them all? Setting The year is 2038. It has been twenty years since the Rending - an event that left most of the world's population dead, their souls severed from their bodies. These souls linger, and survive as ghosts. The surviving humans have done their best to rebuild society, but the world is a very different place. Ghosts roam the land, wild and unpredictable. Their magical abilities make them extremely dangerous to anyone who gets on their bad side. There are rumours, however, of humans developing supernatural abilities. Apparently there are people possessing the same magical abilities as the ghosts, and even people able to control the ghosts themselves. Ghostlords tells the stories of these individuals and the world they live in.\",\n",

Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [ Drawing recommendations ] ▶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. ▶ Choose vivid colors. ▶ Take pictures under good lighting.\",\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game Take care of a group of travelers on a post-apocalyptic road-trip across the United States in this turn-based survival game. Fight off scary creatures, rescue stranded survivors, and scavenge for supplies like fuel, first aid kits, and weapons. Decide where to go next: upgrade this wrecked car, or rescue that dog? And don’t forget, there are consequences for every action. Overland is about close calls, dramatic escapes, hard choices, arguing about whether or not that dog gets rescued, and the end of the world. Features: Stay away from the creatures. Always keep fuel in the tank. Be careful. Be quiet. Loud sounds attract trouble, and there's no way you can fight them all. Grab as much gas as you can, rescue that trapped stranger, and get back in the car before it's too late. Travel through grasslands, over mountains, across deserts, and to even stranger places. Every level, roadmap, and character is randomly generated, so each trip is new. Equip dozens of items, including medkits, shields, axes, potted plants, scavenged armor, and luggage racks. A completely new end of the world from Adam Saltsman, the creator of Canabalt, with gorgeous, award-winning visuals by Heather Penn and a haunting, original soundscape by Jocelyn Reyes. Not everyone is going to make it. \",\n",

OBEY instead puts you in the position to command your enemies (human opponents) , and to be commanded by them.  Players are always free to obey/disobey.  It is always up to players to deal with the consequences of their decisions in the game. You win by bribing and coercing your opponents to do things against their own self interest (and in your interest). If you are being coerced you have only stealth, intelligence, trickery, and creativity to escape. OBEY is sort of like Counter Strike Jailbreak Mod meets Spy Party . OBEY's social aspects have also been compared to Trouble in Terrorist Town and Town of Salem . To win, make more money than any one else by the end of the round. To make the most money,  take command of the giant robot (the robot player makes 10x more than the other players per second) You take control of it by walking into a door at the base of the robot. The player in the robot can easily destroy any player he sees trying to approach (IF he sees them). That’s the basics – so superficially, it plays like ‘king of the hill’. However... Experienced robot players will know that it is not always in their interest to simply kill approaching players. Why not? Because he can instead coerce them to do what he wants. and that’s where the game gets interesting… GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE BY GDOG (Contains instructions for new players) GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE BY FRAGMIX with inset by GEIN GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE OF A TOURNAMENT GAME (experienced players) BUNNY GUARD AT WORK! NOTES ABOUT GAMEPLAY: When playing as robo... you are free to shoot everything that moves (and this might even work against friends or new players), but if you just use this against experienced players you will get subverted, and you will lose. You want your opponents controlled , not hidden and out to subvert you... When playing as a bunny... trying to constantly subvert in the face of an experienced robo is a terrible idea: you will spend most of your game waiting to spawn.  OBEY rewards using TRICKERY , STEALTH , and INTELLIGENCE . OBEY does not reward constant blind 'guns blazing' rushing to the robot. (But what did you expect? you are a baby bunny .vs an enormous mecha-canon-turret). REMEMBER: You will be playing against other human beings - they can not be fooled as easily as AI! \",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game In KILLING FLOOR 2, players descend into continental Europe where the outbreak caused by Horzine Biotech’s failed experiment has quickly spread and gained unstoppable momentum, essentially paralyzing the European Union— Just one month after the events in the original KILLING FLOOR, the specimen clones are everywhere and civilization is in disarray; communications have failed, governments have collapsed, and military forces have been systematically eradicated. The people of Europe know survival and self-preservation too well and lucky survivors have gone into hiding. Not all have given up hope though... A group of civilians and mercenaries have banded together to combat the outbreak and established privately funded operation bases across Europe. Upon tracking specimen clone outbreaks, players will descend into zed-laden hot zones and exterminate them. KEY FEATURES: • Visceral Gore - KILLING FLOOR 2 ramps up the gore with a proprietary, high powered persistent blood system bringing new levels of fidelity to the genre. Players will send entrails, severed limbs, and blood flying as they wade through hordes of enemies. But they need to watch out! If caught, enemies will rip them, and their entire party limb from limb • 6 player co-op or solo play— A multitude of varied playable characters await for players to choose from as they enter the fray in online co-op mode or solo mode for those willing to brave the horrific specimens alone • Versus Survival Game Mode - Be the Zed!  A 12 player PvP mode where two teams take turns playing Humans vs. Zeds in a pair of short matches. In the first match, one team plays Humans and the other Zeds until the humans all die during a single round or they beat the boss. For the second match the teams switch sides and when the battle is completed both teams receive a score based on their performance and the higher score wins! • Terrifying Zeds - New enemies and fan favorites from the original game are back with expanded and smarter artificial intelligence, dishing out powerful attacks, working as a group to weaken the player’s party and pushing the challenge level and fear factor to new levels • Unique Blend Of Weaponry - From modern militaristic assault rifles, brutal improvised makeshift weapons, classic historical guns, and off the wall “Mad Scientist” weapons, KILLING FLOOR 2 has a unique blend of killing tools that will satisfy any gamer • Expanded Perk System - Perks from the original game have been reimagined with more added to the fold. All perks now progress with meaningful talent choices that amplify different play styles, giving players a progression path that is expansive and full of rewarding milestones • Brutal Melee Combat - KILLING FLOOR 2 reinvents melee combat completely. Players now have control over the type of melee attacks they can perform, enabling them to deliver bone-breaking crippling attacks to Zeds • Zed Time - Be the action hero you know you are!  Zed Time returns to Killing Floor 2 better than ever, kicking everything into slow motion giving you that precious time you need to destroy the oncoming horde while watching your weapons at work in glorious high framerate KILLING FLOOR 2 Digital Deluxe Edition adds the following to the base game: DJ Scully character, with unique voice pack and set of face/body skins Additional cosmetic items (each with multiple selectable variants): “Scullyphones” headphones for DJ Scully, Mr Foster, Hayato Tanaka and Donovan Neal 3D Glasses for Ana Larive and Hayato Tanaka Bowler Hat for Mr. Foster and Reverend Alberts Tom Banner and the Zweihander Classic Masterson Classic Briar Oisten Jaegerhorn Anton Strasser Killing Floor 2 Soundtrack Killing Floor 2 Digital Artbook AND a copy of the first Killing Floor!',\n",

This time I decided to test the game with children to balance the difficulty between levels and implement improvements based on their feedback, for example, the player can try to play again the level where he stopped was one of these children's ideas. The game has 30 levels and has full compatibility with xbox 360 controller, and depending on the acceptance of the game I can build more bonus levels based on the feedback of the players. Enjoy, thanks.\",\n",

Challenge yourself to create an efficient & profitable international hub in Career Mode, or create an artistic masterpiece without credit rating worries in Sandbox Mode. Construct your terminal, hire staff, sign airline contracts, tweak the daily flight schedule, configure standby gate availability, plan & design your infrastructure -- bag handling systems, roads & taxiways, fuel systems, runways, gates, hangars, service vehicles, and everything in between.  Deeply simulated gameplay where each detail makes an impact -- down to the trash cans. Simple & familiar controls for a smooth takeoff The starter airport helps get aircraft landing & cash flowing almost immediately.  Aim for profitability by scaling up, but remember:  more passengers, more problems!  Getting 2,000 pax out is easy.  Avoiding bottlenecks for 10k+ pax will likely require different tactics! Large & complex airports require extremely smart designs. Moving walkways, multi-story structures, additional terminals, one-way taxiways, staggered schedules, and careful standby gate allocation -- these are but a sampling of the concepts you'll leverage on your way to truly mastering the art of large-scale airport operations. One size does NOT fit all. It seems simple, placing restrooms or retail areas for instance -- but it's more than meets the eye!  Pax may become distracted when seating or interesting services require a long walk or are far from their gate!  Carefully consider the details to truly maximize your efficiency and reap the profits. Happy Pax, Happy Airline. Getting flights out on-time is only part of the battle.  Ensuring passengers catch their flight is another.  When operations run smoothly & pax are all happily catching their flights you can be pretty sure that the airlines are probably satisfied, too!   If you keep the airlines happy you can probably raise prices without creating too much fuss -- and that leads to bigger profits! Core Gameplay Career Mode & Sandbox Mode (unlimited funds) 16+ Aircraft, turboprop to turbine.  15 Airlines with realistic high-quality textures. 15+ research items to obtain improved transit, reporting, expansion, and other capabilities Comprehensive Fuel System Simulation  Fuel can be a profitable saving grace or you may even decide to sell at-or-below cost as a loss-leader tactic in your effort to gain favor with airlines.  Leverage the Fuel Marketplace as much as you can, too -- with enough capacity you may be able to cash in on any arbitrage opportunities that present themselves which can provide a welcome capital infusion. Deeply Simulated Baggage Handling Systems Conveyor to carousel, every single bag is tracked -- watch as each piece of luggage makes its journey.  Losing bags is a sure way to upset an individual pax, but it also starts causing issues with the airline when occurring often.  Bag handling systems can be quite complicated and you definitely don't want to become a case study like KDEN has!  Take it slow and plan ahead -- building a highly efficient baggage handling operation is no easy task and requires careful planning! Pax Info Systems  Info displays, kiosks, and public address speaker systems complete with Electronics zones to house the required amplifiers.  Keep pax informed and they'll have a greater sense of urgency as their departure time nears and they're be far less likely to needlessly wander from their gate. Robust Queues Extremely powerful queue system provides you with full control.  Supports numerous configurations include 'one-to-many' desks, to assign a single queue to multiple service stations.  Optionally allows restrictions to be set per queue to allow/restrict certain types of people from using the queue (First Class, Coach, and Flight Crew) which you can leverage to create expedited queues for operational efficiency purposes.

Players will take control over one of the major powers that so desperately fought for control over Europe and to end all wars.  Of course the engine has been updated and altered to convincingly simulate Great War warfare. Continues lines of trenches can be created by the player (and the AI) and special rules allow air units to fulfill missions even beyond enemy lines. Other features brought by this title include the new diplomacy system and the new research system. Together, these features, combined with the proven Ageod formula make To End All Wars one of the biggest and most detailed Ageod titles yet! Note: The manual is only available in English. Features Setting: the game covers all of Europe, from the Western seaboard to the Volga, from 1914 to 1918. Middle-East is also in, as well as most of the rest of the world (as off-map boxes regions) Game map is divided into more than 3,000 regions, with a variety of terrain, climates and development level. Scenarios: 1 tutorial and 2 main scenarios of the whole war (historical start in August 1914 and open start with players choosing their own warplans). Historical leaders: Over 1600 historical leaders each rated on their abilities and over 900 different types of units from infantry, to cavalry and artillery to aircrafts and battleships! Production: Control your nations spending on the military, economics, research and diplomacy through a few simple-to-understand assets and production centers. Regional Decision Cards: The game has an innovative card system that lets you trigger events such as Spies, surprise attacks, key trench warfare aspects, technological or tactical breakthrough and, if played wisely can affect the flow of a campaign. Detailed game model includes features such as Weather, Attrition, Supply, Front Lines and Fog of War Historical Events are triggered throughout the game giving the player crucial decision points. These cover anything from local uprising to foreign intervention. Battlefield Tactics allow the player to make decisions that can turn the tide of battle. Sieges and Naval warfare are all covered in detail in the game. Technology over time the technologies available will be upgraded using both the event and cards system. Chain of Command allows units to be organized in to brigades, division, corps and armies and leaders put in command of them. ',\n",

This module includes 20 adventure-packed pages, forming a ready-made adventure for the smallest gaming group. Although it is designed for a Rogue level 7-9, with some minor scaling, The Shroud of Olindor is suitable for use with a traditional four-player party. Lord Dragle was set to auction off his most recent discovery, the Shroud of Olindor. The elven relic was certain to make Dragle a wealthy man. Such a pity he had to die. But the plot surrounding Dragle’s death is far more layered than it appears. It is up to the player character to discover the hidden motives and ultimately recover the Shroud of Olindor. The adventure is a sequel to 1 on 1 Adventures #2: Star of Olindor, although it is easily played as a stand-alone adventure. Don't forget to pick up the follow-up adventure, 1 on 1 Adventures #10: Vengeance of Olindor Author:  Matthew J.

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game  Simplicity to perfection. To be played in bursts. By design, there is no story. Only crazy kung-fu. You're surrounded, outnumbered and have to use any weapon you can get your hands on to dismantle your opponents in a flurry of kung fu.  That's the essence of OFDP2, the world's fastest brawler.  It features the original OFDP's unique two-button mechanics which we've spent the last five years perfecting.  Speed and precision are key in this whirlwind fighting frenzy, as players maintain control over the 26 different unlockable skills, frenetic gameplay, and classic kung fu-inspired animations. ATTACK LEFT or ATTACK RIGHT We want to show that a fighting game can be complex without cumbersome button combinations.  Once players complete the tutorial levels and learn the basics, they'll see that this is the most intense two-button game ever made. With 1000 different animations available, literally, anything is possible—particularly when players unlock each of the 26 available skills.  Having these skills available simultaneously is a major design challenge that encompasses the core of what OFDP2 is trying to achieve.   Seeing the game with all 26 skills is a spectacle unique to OFDP2. We built this game as a palette cleanser between other games in your library. It was designed to deliver a quick hit of adrenalin as fast as possible. You can't get a feel for the gameplay from watching videos.  The flow of combat is something we spent years tweaking.  It's what makes OFDP2 unique.  Only by playing it will this become clear.  That's why it's important to us that you TRY THE DEMO out before you consider purchasing this game. *You can turn the announcer on or off in the options. *64 bit operating systems only. *Windows 7 might have issues playing the few video files in the game. EASY TO LEARN THE WORLD'S FASTEST BRAWLER OUR ONLY GOAL WAS TO CREATE FUN 400+ LEVELS - 26 SKILLS - 4 ENDLESS SURVIVAL TOWERS \",\n",

Farragnarok is a mysterious set of lands, starting with the Land of Horticulture and Essence (LOHAE). LOHAE is a peaceful tree growing simulation game with definitely no secrets.  Taking on the mythological role of a Reaper of Life, you must Choose whether to destroy life, or to destroy using the power of life. You can also enjoy the demo of the Land of Mists and Trails, an \"Oregon Trail\" like game where you ferry the souls of the dead to their final resting place. Future lands will include features such as: a tower defender, a word puzzle, a procedural story generator, a walking simulator, and a  city building game.  All will be woven together by a thread of narrative significance, sometimes subtle, gradually growing more and more relevant. Don\\'t worry about that \"essence\" bullsh**t. Who even cares about it? Not smart Players like you.  The Sleeping Serpent? Never heard of \\'em. Must not have made it into this version of the game. You found a flashlight? Weird. Probably doesn\\'t do anything.

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game Scenner is a single-player sci-fi and survival horror game. The game takes place on a space transportation shuttle “ scenner“. In the game, you take the role of a mercenary who was tasked to get into the spacecraft and find the disk with data before the rescue squad arrives. As you get into the space shuttle, you find an anomaly— areas with radioactivity where the photons are perishing. It means you won't be able to use any lighting devices while moving through the areas with the anomaly. You'll have to navigate by the sound using a sonar. During the expedition conducted by a group of astronauts and scientists to the planetoid K-77, the connection with the spacecraft was suddenly lost. It took long before it was managed to reconnect. But six months later satellites detected a signal from the missing space shuttle 4 billion kilometers away from K-77. According to the directives of space security service, in case of an incident with a vehicle, access to the craft without required admittance should be restricted, until the matter is clarified. Remote scanning of all systems revealed that two-way connection was working well in test mode. But there was no response to messages, though according to all indicators it was obvious, there was someone on board. So what has actually happened? How did the spacecraft with no hyper engines manage to cover such a huge distance from the place where the connection was lost for such a short period of time? Why isn't anybody responding to the messages though it's obvious there is someone on board?\",\n",

Never opened to the public, the museum's secrets are yours to discover. Experience the atmosphere of six uniquely themed exhibits. Solve puzzles of varying difficulty. Stuck on a puzzle? Go explore and come back to it! Learn the history of death through the ages. Admire real death-themed artwork from different cultures and time periods. Monarchs, prisoners, deserters, and witches all have one thing in common - the occasional early demise at the hands of an executioner. Learn about execution methods from the middle ages to the 20th century then escape this exhibit unscathed. Spanish conquistadors wrote of their horror upon first witnessing Aztec sacrifices. You won't see anything quite so gruesome here, but you can see some artistic depictions inside the museum's Aztec-themed pyramid. Keep your head down while exploring this recreation of a World War II trench and you'll find your way to the dugout. Check out the collection of war posters and listen to real war-era radio broadcasts while you're there. Take a stroll through the museum's own mini-graveyard and enjoy the atmosphere of a starry night among the graves. Try out the interactive cremation exhibit, but don't let the dust get in your eyes. Do you know who Pesta The Plague Hag is? You will. Planning your visit You should expect to spend around an hour at the museum. You'll likely complete your tour in one visit, but you can leave and pick up where you left off at any time. No hand stamp required. There are no jump-scares in the museum. It's a little creepy, but nothing will pop up and scare you. The museum contains artwork depicting death, but nothing excessively graphic. \",\n",

Newcastle International was rated the 11th busiest airport in the UK, and the second busiest in Northern England, with Manchester coming first, handling over 4.8 million passengers. The airport is owned by seven local authorities: City of Newcastle, City of Sunderland, Durham County Council, Gateshead MBC, North Tyneside MBC, Northumberland County Council and South Tyneside MBC. Copenhagen Airport sold the stake in Newcastle to AMP Capital, which is an Australian based investment company. Newcastle airport was opened on 26th July 1935 and was known back then as Woolsington Aerodrome – the airport was opened by Sirt Phillip Cunliffe-Lister, Secretary of State for Air. At this time, the airport consisted of one clubhouse, one hangar, few workshops, a fuel garage and a single grass runway with a building cost of around £35,000.

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game Move the cube and find the best path to your destination. Solve tricky puzzles and escape malicious traps. The difficulty is between challenging and easy. The gameplay varies between action platforming and puzzle solving. Touch other cubes so they follow you and direct them to triggers. Floating platforms will fly away if you don’t pay attention when you are stepping off them. Move crates in front of lasers so you can pass. Use cranes and elevators to transport yourself through the level. But all these things are only possible if you avoid spikes, flamethrowers and enemy cubes that get in your way. The gameplay and controls make it simple to pick up, easy to play and the different mechanics keep you engaged throughout the game.',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game  Before you start, remember to break the barrier of prejudice because there will be no low-res spaceships in this game! Beekyr Reloaded is an hardcore bee'em up game (shoot'em up with bees). The game breaks molds, moving away from the typical STG game, avoiding the space theme mixing vertical and horizontal scrolling stages with fun game mechanics. Each stage is very different from the previous: one level we could be fighting poisonous scorpions, another defending the hive collecting pollen, dodging bee-eaters, raiding dark caves protected by the most evil of wasps: Hornets. Features Mold-breaking theme: Based in the treacherous world of insects. 'Shmup first-play' friendly gameplay: Novice mode and 'Generic Shoot’em up/STG Tutorial' to enable new players understand and enjoy all shmup games. Horizontal and Vertical stages with very different game formats! 17 cool bosses to fight Tons of secrets: multiple playable characters, multiple endings, unlockable stages / worlds, retro visual effects. Real co-op multiplayer mode Enormous re-playability: 4 different stage combinations that might offer from 18 to 29 stages. Depending on game events / difficulty mode Global rank system, achievements Natural hazards in each level (storms, waterfalls, wind, rocks, darkness...) Powerups system. Innovatives 'Bee-squad' bomb and 'Bee-swarm' flock attack! Precise analog or digital controls: Steam and Xbox 360 controller support Game Crossovers Over 20 visual screen effects: Retro Arcade visuals, CRT monochrome, old cinema, sepia, vintage cameras, pixelated, trippin' and many more. Amazing soundtrack Game Modes Novice: (19 Stages) Learn how to play a shoot'em up game (a.k.a shmup) and get ready for the real action. Arcade: (25 Stages) Play the game at its original difficulty designed to have you playing for hours to reach a total completed game. Bullet hell: (28 Stages) Play the game similar to a bullet hell game, plus some extra levels. Expert: (28 Stages) Play the game harder and with some extra levels. Elite: (18 Stages) Play the game even harder, beat the game and receive at home a reward from Kaleidogames if you are one of the first few to accomplish it. \",\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game In Duskers you pilot drones into derelict spaceships to find the means to survive and piece together how the universe became a giant graveyard. Explore You are a drone operator, surrounded by old gritty tech that acts as your only eyes and ears to the outside world. What you hear comes through a remote microphone. What you see is how each drone sees the world. Motion sensors tell you something's out there, but not what. And when you issue commands, you do it through a command line interface. Adapt You have to earn everything in Duskers, scavenging drone upgrades, drones, and even ship upgrades. But dangerous creatures lurk in these derelict ships, and weapons are rare, so you may need to think of a clever way to explore a military outpost using only a motion sensor and a lure. But even if you find a way, the sensor that you rely on may  break down, or you may run out of lures, even your drone's camera feed can start to fail.  A favorite strategy can't be exploited for long, so you'll have to continually adapt. Survive Duskers is set in a procedurally generated Universe, and when you die you lose everything. You not only need to worry about what hazards lay waiting for you in the derelicts, but also running out of fuel, or parts to modify your drones and ship. You are alone, isolated in the dark reaches of space. Only by sifting through what ship logs remain un-corrupted can you piece together what happened. Features - Use a Command Line Interface to control drones & ship systems - Explore procedurally generated derelict ships and universe - Upgrade and modify drones with the salvage you find - Discover ship logs and piece together what happened About Us We previously made A Virus Named TOM and then were fortunate enough to get Indie Fund to help us fund Duskers.

Mind the Gap Stealing Time The Grand Derby Clockwork Dreams Pre-Gens Centri-Fugue Your adventurers open their eyes and find themselves strewn around a smoke-filled clearing surrounded by trees. As they struggle to their feet under a heavy sensation of vertigo, each of them realizes they have no recollection where they are or how they got here. They remember their own names, and they remember each other and past adventures they’ve had together, their own histories, even what happened yesterday – but their short-term memory is totally inaccessible. Um, What Did I Just Drink? One day, an envelope finds its way to one of your adventurers. It seems that Uncle Erwin has passed away, and his last will and testament bequeaths everything to that character. An address is listed in the will, some street in Thistledown County (Verna), not too far from Hawthorne. The will states, All the accumulation of my worldly goods and accomplishments are under that roof. May they see you to better times. Mind the Gap It seemed a nice enough day when your adventurers boarded the Tube in the Idlewyld region of Torridaen. Perhaps they’re returning from a well-earned vacation to the copper dust beaches, or just on their way to it. Maybe they’re there on some business. The sounds of shouting interrupt their otherwise pleasant ride, coming from the next car over. No usher is in sight yet, and passengers in your adventurers’ car begin to exchange nervous glances. Your adventurers overhear bits and pieces of an agitated male voice saying, “Stop them from... you don’t understand how close... keep it super-heated... going to die!” Stealing Time “Hold there! This is our road you gents are usin’, and we require a... modest toll for passage. Wages for our constant vigilance and upkeep of the area, you understand.” On their way to (or from) Lothengard one night, your adventurers suddenly find themselves surrounded by a band of highwaymen. The Grand Derby There are two phases to this scenario, the building of the krank and the Derby itself. There are endless permutations of designs, so your adventurers’ options are wide open. Technomagical weaponry and gadgets are not only permitted to be built into the kranks, but encouraged. The crowd loves a good show. There are no size restrictions, so many competitor’s designs have been getting progressively larger over the years. A copy of Savage Suzerain is required to use some parts of this product. Conversion by: Jeannette Jarrar Released on March 29, 2018. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 3.3.4 and higher. Requires: An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds ruleset.',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Content In 2017, we upgraded Jazzpunk to Jazzpunk: Director's Cut , adding in a ton of new content for free.  Alongside this upgrade, we decided to release an optional Mini-Mission, The Flavour Nexus , so that fans of the series could continue to support us, and we can keep making the games you love. The Flavour Nexus is a lost chapter from Jazzpunk , and takes place *spoilers* between the Daytime Tiki Resort and Nighttime Tiki Resort missions, when Polybank is poisoned and concussed. This is a short(!) mission, playtime averages around 20-50min, depending on how you play and explore, and it is priced to reflect this. So if you would like to continue supporting us as a studio, please consider throwing a buck/euro/pound/kroner into our tip jar, and grab yourself some Flavour Nexus ! Flavour Nexus can be accessed through the Extras section in the title screen.\",\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game   Conducting teaching work As a Principal, your most important work is to arrange the teaching tasks reasonably; and the cornerstone of teaching is to teach students in accordance with their aptitude. A good principal will determine the teaching method based on each student's personality and talent. Whether students are to study in arts or science classes, to be assigned to key classes or regular classes, or to concentrate underachievers in the ignorable class, or to make no social distinctions in teaching, will be decided by the player himself. Maintenance of school discipline Maintaining discipline is an important means of ensuring the enrollment rate of a school. Every student has his or her own behavior pattern. They will sleep, read comics, listen to music in classes, keep monstrous hairstyles, smoke in the toilet, go over the wall to various entertainment venues, and even gang up to go to the Internet cafe to play computer games. To improve students' scores, you must use a variety of measures to prevent violations from spreading among students. For this reason, you can choose to punish the students who violated the school rules by penalties including standing before the class, running laps, writing self-criticism, even demerit recording and expulsion. Special means to maintain financial balance To ensure the enrollment rate, quality teachers must be guaranteed. But training excellent teachers requires a good deal of money. As a first-class Principal, you must increase income and reduce expenditure through various means. If necessary, some special means can also be adopted. For example, by collecting school-choosing fees and increasing the prices of canteen dishes, a large amount of funds can be obtained in a short time. However, these methods often come with negative effects and should be used with caution. Coping with inspection from leaders Being a principal in China not only requires you to complete your own teaching tasks, but also to learn to deal with all kinds of inspection by superiors, who will assign you some special documents, such as: reducing the burden of students, conducting quality education, and offering nutritious meals for students. If the leaders are not satisfied, you will face serious consequences.\",\n",

This fantasy solo RPG combines unique, simultaneous turn-based combat with a journey that changes based on each figurine you take into Firetop Mountain! Which hero will you take into Zagor's lair THIS time? The original 1982 Fighting Fantasy gamebook paperback, written by Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson, has been transformed into an epic table-top adventure game, with new areas to explore, characters to meet, and of course, monsters to slay! Zagor's home assembles right before your eyes as you travel deep into the belly of the mountain. Each character has their own motivations for being in Firetop Mountain, changing the way the gamebook is written and choices presented. Combat is fought using the digital miniatures in a simultaneous, turn-based system called GridBluff, and the game includes over 100 unique hero and monster figurines to discover. Choose Your Own Adventure Battle, sneak, and charm your way through thousands of story options as you play through over a dozen major quests, each unique to a different Hero. Simultaneous Turn-Based Combat Experiment with a slew of interesting battle strategies! Each Hero comes with their own set of attacks and manoeuvres.

Venture forth, kill monsters and earn Souls to prove your might and unlock all eighteen Heroes. Which Hero will YOU take into the Mountain? Will you play as the noble and experienced adventurer Alexandra of Blacksand? Or perhaps take the pious and righteous path of battle-priest Landov Lowan?

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content Train Simulator’s Peninsula Corridor route delivers dynamic and modern American commuter railroading on the renowned commuter rail line operated by Caltrain along California’s vibrant and bustling San Francisco Peninsula! Train Simulator’s Peninsula Corridor route extends between San Francisco’s busy 4th & King Street station and San Jose Diridon station and serves a total of 26 Caltrain commuter stations along the multi-track route’s 47-mile length. In addition to Caltrain’s commuter operations, this authentic and highly detailed Train Simulator route provides the opportunity to operate Union Pacific freight services on the Peninsula. In serving San Francisco and portions of California’s vibrant “Silicon Valley,” Caltrain has since its creation in the 1980s emerged as a vital and innovative commuter railroad, carrying more than 17 million riders per year. In 2003, Caltrain introduced its popular “Baby Bullet” express commuter trains employing distinctive MPI MP36PH-3C diesels and Bombardier Bi-Level “push-pull” commuter equipment, and the stylish MPXpress diesel and Bombardier equipment are included with Train Simulator’s Peninsula Corridor route. Along with the route’s masterfully re-created and unique commuter stations, Caltrain’s expansive Central Equipment & Maintenance Facility (CEMOF), located near the San Jose Diridon station, is included. Rail giant Union Pacific operates freight services on the line and Train Simulator’s Peninsula Corridor route also features a versatile Union Pacific Electro-Motive GP38-2 diesel locomotive and accompanying contemporary UP freight equipment. Whether the challenge is keeping on schedule with a Caltrain commuter making stops at the route’s numerous stations, fast running (up to 79-mph), or toting freight tonnage, Train Simulator’s Peninsula Corridor route promises contemporary American railroading at its best! Scenarios The Peninsula Corridor route includes seven challenging career scenarios featuring the Caltrain MPI MP36PH-3C and Caltrain Bombardier Bi-Levels in commuter service and the Union Pacific Electro-Motive GP38-2 in freight and switching duty.

As more users embrace VR, VR review will become a key step to all 3D content creation.  Being able to review content in VR directly via Modo greatly reduces time needed to switch applications, and greatly improves the overall immersion and connection an artist has with an object’s scale and perspective. Modo VR is perfect for 3D content creators preparing data VR and AR experiences, and also provides accurate scale and context for designers developing items for real-world construction.  Modo indie VR is one of many research projects to come out of Foundry Research and, as such, is not targeted to a specific release of Modo at this time. In the future, after gathering additional end user feedback, it may be released as part of a later Modo release or as a separate product.',\n",

This is rendition of the airport Calvi - Sainte Catherine for X-Plane. The airport itself has been faithfully recreated with high resolution aerial images, numerous custom 3D objects and exact ground markings, including the old painted-over markings. It also includes reworked terrain and an impressive night lightning. The developers have also paid great attention to the surrounding area of the airport, the nearby business park and the citadel of Calvi. Landing approaches are particular fun in Calvi: While Sainte Catherine is usually approached from the seaside; pilots can fly past the airport to the west, then turn by 180 degrees and approach the runway from the south.

First you must pick your vehicle, each vehicle has its own stats, which include the time it takes for the police to arrest you, to the amount of cash you earn per coin. But don't think you can just pick the vehicle with the highest income, having a vehicle with an higher income will generally be harder to steer or have a quicker arrest time. Pick the vehicle that works for you! While you're evading the police you must also manually switch between cameras to keep your vehicle in view, don't expect this to be easy. You do however have the 'SAT CAM' pickup which will remove this problem, allowing you to focus on driving. The 'SAT CAM' pickup will always be in the city somewhere, so finding and collecting this should be your first priority. Allows you to play from the 'SAT CAM' view point from the very start without any pickups. Designed for the casual player who just wants to test their skills evading the police while using a more original camera setup. Cash Grab - You and a friend can both have fun evading the police, first to reach the required cash wins or just crash into your friend and make sure the police catch them. Head to Head - Go head to head with a friend with one of you taking control of the police * Please Note: Full size keyboard required for split screen. * New content will be added throughout early access and this description will be updated as such \",\n",

Please expect our games to be smaller, raw experiences. We always love to chat with you guys and greatly appreciate all of your feedback in order to become better game creators. Just tell us your questions or ideas on the forums, Twitter or Facebook. If you encounter bugs or any problems, we will do all we can to ensure the best support that a drunken ape could possibly give. Have fun playing - DRUNKEN APES The game offers 13 crazy tracks and we are continuously working on more awesome tracks and gravity bending hyper speed areas. Currently, there are 9 unique hyper speed cars in the game. Every car has a different handling and requires a different skill level and experience. Finding the perfect car for your driving style will be essential to set new high scores and beat your friends and other competitors. HYPER DRIVE does not only come with the fastest cars and the weirdest and most unique tracks you can find in a racing game, it also can be played in 3 different game modes: 🔸 Do you like it hard? Do you think hard is too casual? DO YOU LIKE HYPER? Try the HYPER MODE, finish a lab without dying in order to beat the high score! 🔸 Practice the labs and car handling in the PRACTICE MODE. 🔸 We are currently working on the TIME MODE. It is much more forgiving and lets you respawn once you have died. 🔸 13 crazy tracks 🔸 9 cars with different speed and handling 🔸 artistic surroundings and track design 🔸 HYPER GRAVITY 🔸 several game modes 🔸 unique stylized speed experience Each of the modes above can be played alone or with your friends in split screen (coming soon) ',\n",

It was late evening and the museum was almost empty. At the Maya artifact exhibition, one of the exhibits suddenly started to move. The sound drew the attention of a young woman named Diana, a museum employee and an expert in Mayan culture. When she came closer to the artifact she realized it looked like a portal... and suddenly some unknown power lifted her up and teleported her to an ancient temple! Now Diana has to figure out where she is, how she got there and how she\\'s going to return home. The young woman encounters a civilization similar to the Mayan culture, but this is neither the past nor a parallel reality. It\\'s another planet, connected to Earth centuries ago by some special gates. And now the gates have been activated again...  Only Shaash, the local shaman and gate keeper, can help Diana return home. But that will not be easy. Diana will have to face numerous tests, travel far through the Endless River Valley, encountering the strange people and wondrous animals of the other world, while trying to hide from all dangers and solving dozens of different challenges on her way.  - Multiple wonderful locations and stunning graphics - Unexpected plot turns - Unforgettable characters - Fascinating mini-games and puzzles',\n",

Only Dr. Rick Norberg and the friendly robot \"AB\" can help John to recover from his brain damage and restore his broken memory. By falling asleep and rediscovering the past in his dreams, John can restore his memory and remember what caused the unfortunate catastrophe in one of the most secretive laboratories of the \"Revivel\" company. But due to John\\'s brain damage, falling asleep won\\'t be as easy as it seems at first... John will start to hallucinate and hear sounds that will only make it harder to fall asleep. Only by dealing with his fears and staying calm can he successfully fall asleep, otherwise, his overwhelmingly high stress may lead to an untimely death ... “Try to Fall Asleep” is an indie horror game. The main goal of the game is to fall asleep before the time runs out. The brain damage from the accident won’t help, since it’ll make you hallucinate terrible things.  Once you fall asleep, you\\'ll start to dream and relive the horror that lead up to the horrific catastrophe. At its core it has an interesting story with a very deep and intriguing lore. With the help of an info panel at the bottom left corner, you\\'ll be able to monitor your stress and sleep levels. Any hallucination or anomaly will raise the stress level and if it fills up, the game will be over. Calm your stress by turning on the old fashioned lamp. However, it may burn out if you use it too much. The more you keep your eyes closed, the more sleep you\\'ll get and the higher the sleep level will be. Once it\\'s full, you\\'ll fall asleep and start to dream... ',\n",

Squeezed in between the sea and the city, it has one of the most scenic approaches in the Mediterranean.  Heraklion’s location and pleasant climate make it an incredibly popular destination for many people. So popular in fact, that this airport will soon be replaced by a new one as it is no longer able to handle heavy traffic in the summer. That means the only way you will be able to visit this iconic airport is in the virtual world!  FSDG’s incarnation of Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is fully detailed, complete with famous landmarks, high resolution ground textures, photo real terrain coverage of Heraklion and custom terrain mesh. The airport itself features local apron vehicles along with realistic car traffic, complete and detailed airport lighting and detailed 3D objects.

The new skin is applied when downloaded (to revert, simply uninstall). Tirsyth Garment The Elves of Athel Loren's other realms consider the Ashenhall to be a drab and sombre place. As proof they point to the lugubrious character of its in inhabitants and the cinereal colourings of their raiment. There is no joyful song in Ashenhall, they say, just the dirges of Elves who live ever under the shadow of death. In truth, the Elves of Tirsyth are no more fatalistic than others of their kind - they simply revere life as fervently as they do its start. So do Ashenhall's Elves fill their glades with intricate moonstone statues of the departed, so that they might remember and honour the deceased even if their kin elsewhere in the forest do not. The forest spirits respect this gesture for reasons of their own, and groves of Treemen have sprung up around statues of those Elves beloved of the forest. Woe betide he who interferes with such a shrine.\",\n",

STORY Prepare for the most dramatic and moving story in the world of climbing - ever. You climbed. You fell. You died. You were resurrected by The Mysterious Green Goo™. HOW TO ANIMATE THE CORPSE Thanks to The Mysterious Green Goo™ your hands stick to the rock wall. To climb, you unstick, move and restick every hand separately, using your keyboard and mouse or gamepad. Watch out for your goo level. It decreases with every grip and also with time, so you’d better make every move count – just like in golf! Or something... On your way to the top you’ll also find glowing green mucus. Go for it to increase your Goo level. When you catch the rhythm, you’ll be speeding along the rock walls, your character ragdolling like crazy. Make him dance, make him twitch, you can do it, there’s nothing to it!! YOU CAN CHOOSE First of all, in Dead Climb you can choose your own path along the rock wall. You can also choose from various mountains, character models and climbing modes. In Free Climbing mode you manage your Goo resource, but in Time Attack you have a time limit on top of that. Avoid Danger mode requires you to move sideways to avoid falling boulders. More moves use more Goo. Tactics! ',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content Night Environment: Italy for FSX: Steam Edition revolutionizes your night flying experience in Italy. Using a series of databases, this add-on adds appropriate types of lighting to different kinds of roads and other areas. 100,000s of lights clearly show how both highways and smaller roads alike. Visual navigation at night becomes an absolute joy with this stunning pack! The Night Environment database contains an incredible amount of accurate road data, illuminating roads at night which you wouldn’t normally see. Our lights have up to a 60 mile radius, so large urban areas and highway junctions will illuminate all around you as you fly. As the highway lights are raised above the surface and have a lit bitmap below them, a realistic 3D effect is created. Night Environment also comes with a configuration tool so you can customize the intensity of your night flying experience. Features: Full coverage of Italy. All major roads and most smaller roads are illuminated. Compatible with other scenery add-ons (including Orbx FTX and most photoscenery). Configurable for hardware performance. Management tool, accessible via the Steam Tools menu, which allows you to toggle and adjust the output of all types of lights. ',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Content  Their horsemen ride like thunder across the plain, like the kings of old! The Jackal & The Khan DLC adds an additional Crusader Trail campaign and a duo of new AI opponents. Two men destined to lead their forces across the wilds of the desert plain, The Jackal and The Khan are outcast warriors forced to survive on their wits and the loyalty of their men. Both nomads in their own way, the animalistic Khan and the fearless Jackal represent the ultimate challenge for Stronghold players. The latest character pack DLC for Stronghold Crusader 2, The Jackal & The Khan adds nine new missions, two AI opponents, achievements, custom in-game shields and castle designs unique to these new Lords. The Jackal A skilled warlord who shields his face behind by a large metal helm, fashioned in the shape of a jackal’s head, Crusader 2 returns The Jackal to his homeland. After The Wolf is impaled and thrown from his tower at the end of the original Stronghold (2001) he is taken east, where he is miraculously restored to health by The Jackal and his allies. After mending his broken bones The Jackal eventually becomes The Wolf’s subordinate, earning his master's trust by killing the King and replacing The Pig as chief warlord. Unlike The Pig or indeed The Rat, The Jackal appears unafraid of The Wolf. Disagreeing with orders and seeking to provide counsel in his own way, The Jackal challenges The Wolf as an equal. After his military campaign against The Boy fails, The Jackal chooses to desert his stubborn leader and return to his native lands. Here he bides his time, exacting revenge on those who wronged him when the moment is opportune. The Khan The Khan is a nomad closely connected to his lands, both in terms of his past and play style. For most of his adult life The Khan has acted as head for his pack of roaming soldiers. More travelling warriors than mercenaries seeking to turn a profit, The Khan's men are in search of a good fight and glorious victories. Over the years The Khan's leadership has taken his makeshift army between lands with no permanent home or base of operations, always more interested in the journey and victories secured along the way. His army is animalistic and wild, operating in packs and always seeking out new resources to plunder. DLC Features New Missions - Lead the pack to victory with nine new single-player missions in 'The Jackal & The Khan' Skirmish Trail. Two Characters - The Jackal and The Khan enter the fray as AI opponents in a new Crusader Trail, Skirmish Mode and Multiplayer. Unique Castles - Inventive wall layouts, ample siege defenses and some of the strongest fortifications in the game. Custom Shields - Customize your in-game shield with five new designs, representing the paths of the warlord and the nomad. Extra Achievements - Discover new Steam achievements and set yourself apart as a true master of warfare. Please Note : The Jackal and The Khan is downloadable add-on content, requiring the full Stronghold Crusader 2 game on Steam to play.\",\n",

About Viticulture You find yourself in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany, where you’ve inherited a meager vineyard. You own a few plots of land, an old crush pad, a tiny cellar, 3 workers…and the dream of owning the best winery in Italy. Your job is to allocate your workers and helpful visitors to complete various tasks throughout the year. Each season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There’s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to arrive at each one has an advantage over the rest. Using those workers and visitors, you can expand your vineyard by building structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders as you work towards the goal of owning the most successful winery in Tuscany. About Tuscany This expansion to Viticulture includes the extended board, special workers, and structure cards. 1-6 players | Ages 13 & Up 25 minutes per player About Moor Visitors The Moor Visitors Expansion adds 40 new visitor cards to Viticulture. 1-6 players | Ages 13 & Up ~20 minutes per player',\n",

The hard worker was delighted and thought he had found a treasure. Unfortunately, the find was not the best event in his life. It was not a large metal chest with images of people and incomprehensible symbols. Inside the sarcophagus, the mummy of the child was wrapped in decayed cloth. He closed the lid, not wanting to poke around. By evening, a very high temperature had risen, sound hallucinations appeared. In the morning, the man turned into a decaying monster. A distraught monster ran into the street in panic. Not recognizing a person in him and a very frightened neighbor shot him with a hunting rifle. It was the beginning of  terrible, unknown epidemic. People became infected one by one, expanding the domain of death. For unknown reasons, the virus bypasses some people. Attempts to cure infected were unsuccessful. Desperate favorites take up arms, trying to fix this situation.  The main character enters a world filled with zombie mutants. In this deserted place, danger traps the player at every turn. When an enemy appears, the radar is triggered, warning you with a sound and a display on a mini-map. Replenish ammunition and first-aid kits also relying on these mini-maps. With a large influx of zombies, cartridges end quickly. Assessing the situation, calculate your strength. Every shot counts! Destroy the crowd of the undead, constantly looking for a new victim. Extinguish a rapidly spreading infection. in this locality for the salvation of mankind.',\n",

Your pathogen has just infected 'Patient Zero' - now you must bring about the end of human history by evolving a deadly, global Plague whilst adapting against everything humanity can do to defend itself. Plague Inc. is so realistic that the CDC even asked the developer to come and speak about the infection models in the game! http://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2013/04/plague-inc/ . Over 120 million players have been infected by Plague Inc. already. Now, Plague Inc: Evolved combines the original critically acclaimed gameplay with significant, all-new features for PC including multiplayer, user-generated content support, improved graphics and lots more. 10 Different Disease Types – Master every pathogen; from bacteria to bio-weapons and mind control to zombies, end humanity by any means possible – different diseases will need radically different approaches. 23 Unique Scenarios – Adapt your strategy; scenarios create further challenges for your pandemic – how will you handle a new strain of Swine Flu, or infect a world in Ice Age? Hyper-Realistic World – Strategize in the real world; advanced AI and use of real-world data and events make Plague Inc: Evolved a highly authentic simulation of a world-ending pathogen. Even the CDC likes it! Competitive Multiplayer - The world is unlucky enough to be infected with two plagues, but how will you win the battle for genetic dominance against your opponent? Players get all new evolutions, abilities and genes to help them fight for global control and destroy their opponent! Co-Operative Mode -  Two different diseases team up to infect and destroy the world together but Humanity has new tricks up its sleeve to fight back! Work closely with your partner and use brand-new genes, traits and strategies to smash cure labs all over the world before they eradicate you. Contagious Content Creator - Hit the lab and develop your own custom scenarios - creating new plague types, worlds and in-game events. Sophisticated tools support user-generated content to let players bring their deadliest ideas to life and share them on Steam Workshop. With over 10,000 custom scenarios already released - there is always something new to infect! Blinding Graphics - Full 3D disease models take you closer to your plague than ever before, city-cams show humanity's struggle at street level, and the body scanner highlights the full effect of your mutations, organ by organ. Deadly Data - Geek out with stats and graphs; monitor infection and death levels, track government reactions and cure efforts, then review your plague's success (or failure!) with full game replays. And much more... - Including speed runs, Mega-Brutal difficulty and genetic modification... Plus loads of new disease types and scenarios in future (free!) updates. \",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game  \"Tactical Leaping Adventure - Jump King: There is a Smoking Hot Babe at the Top!\" is a platforming challenge about struggling upwards in search of the legendary Smoking Hot Babe! You are alone on this adventure, and to reach the top you will need to master the technique of jumping. Just try to remember that with each fall there is a lesson to be learned... Gameplay: Prepare for true high-stakes platforming, where you have to use your mind to triumph! On your vertical adventure tension will rise with each jump, even though you cannot die! The reason is that a single missed jump could lead to a long fall, and once you have fallen you have to get back up again yourself... The mechanics are simple: hold to charge the height of each jump and release to leap away! Despite its simplicity it will take much practice to master. You will have to consider each situation carefully before you jump, because once you are in the air there is no way to turn back!   Atmosphere: Leap through an intriguing world and meet curious characters along your way. Hand-drawn backgrounds and distinct animations paint a rare picture, while the blend of retro sfx, beautiful arrangements and high definition ambiences give a peculiar atmosphere - thanks to composers/sound designers Nils Eklöf and Elias Thörnlund. Do you have the guts to take that jump? The last hour led to this point, now everything is on the line! Will you get that Babe? Will you reach the Top? Do you think you have what it takes to defeat this game!? Features: The only way forward is up, and your only enemy is yourself! Simple but iconic jump-mechanic, charge each jump just right! Once you leap away there is no retreat. Tactical platformer; the obvious path is sometimes not the best... Mysterious world with characters that you will learn to love and hate. The higher you jump, the harder you fall! All your progress (and each setback) is saved automatically! That jump which you so easily cleared a moment ago has somehow turned into the hardest jump in the game - what are you going to do? Cry about it? You only have yourself to blame! He he he... Classic graphics - painstakingly hand drawn backgrounds. Tough but addictive gameplay. Challenge your friends to see who can first master this test of resolve! Hours of nail-biting suspense await you! Full controller support and freely rebindable keys. ',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game Wayward Souls is a randomly generated action-RPG with a heavy focus on story. Play as seven different heroes, all with their own abilities and playstyles. Fight through steadily greater hordes of enemies, as you learn about each character and find out what happened in the cursed tower you find yourself in. Greatly inspired by 90's era action-RPG's, but with a faster pace and a focus on randomized replay value. Customize each character with their own upgrades and equipment sets that change their movesets and abilities. Over 100 different monster types. Over 300 hats (IMPORTANT) Unique story events for every playable character. Many different areas, room types, rare rooms, encounters, and secrets. Unlockable game modes, including Endless Mode. Heavy replay value due to randomly generated levels, multiple character types, and randomized enemy groups. Hero Characters and Abilities Renee uses her mobility to dash through enemies. Her Power Attack is a kick that stuns, with effects depending on her boots. She frequently finds items that let her blind, stun, or poison enemies. All of these let her perform very damaging backstabs. Equipment and Upgrade Examples: Mirage Dagger randomly gives her short bursts of stealth during her dashes. Giantstomper Boots upgrade her kicks to send enemies flying far back. Flung enemies will then damage and stun enemies they crash into. The Giantstompers also interrupt larger enemies that are stun resistant. Toadskin Cowters poison enemies that hit her, stunning them after a few seconds. Her Low Blow Upgrade permanently makes it so defeating large enemies will make her next dagger attack stun whatever she hits, even if her slash hits multiple enemies. Blythe combines durability with a big sword that cleaves a wide area. He has a shield to block enemy attacks, and throwing axes for when he needs a faster or more long ranged option than his sword provides. Duskhander Sword replaces his default Power Attack's charging slash with a whirlwind spin, hitting enemies over a larger area. Magebane Gauntlets reduces the damage of enemy spells, while making his throwing axes destroy any enemy spell they pass through. Stonebeard Slab is much more durable than the default shield, but makes him move very slowly when holding the shield out to block. Drakefire Oil is an item the Warrior can use to make all his sword swings emit a traveling wave of flame, for a limited time. Abbie has long ranged magic attacks that do heavy damage. Her Power Attack uses her staff for shots that are longer range and pierce multiple enemies. In a tough situation, she has limited use spells for both offense and defense. Salamander's Breath Staff turns her magical shots into bursts of flame that pierce even more enemies, but have very short range. Tremor Garb gives her a powerful footstomp that creates a shockwave to stun enemies and destroy enemy projectiles. Manablade Arts lets her summon a sword that does high damage, interrupts enemy attacks, can reflect enemy spells, and has a small chance to stun. The Mage can find powerful one use scrolls such as Fireball or Lightning Bolt, which inflict massive damage and stun to multiple enemies. More characters details soon! \",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game  Solarix is a science-fiction stealth-horror game featuring open-ended levels for both combative and stealth-focused playstyles. Solarix combines old-school sci-fi horror with next-gen style and graphics. The story follows an electrical engineer desperately fighting for his life after an infection wipes out an interstellar research station. He must contain the disease, battling both the remnants of the crew and his own fracturing mind. Our goal is to go beyond jumpscares and cheap thrills. Solarix is about a world that overpowers you with unease, insecurity, and desperation, forcing you to confront your own role in the horrors to come. Features: 12 chapters with engrossing story line with lots of unique characters that provide psychological depth to player experience of survival horror. Variety of weapons and hacking tools allowing the player to develop different strategies to overcome obstacles and progress for sneaking & combat & puzzle solving & environmental interaction. Advanced Stealth A.I with varying voice sets & detection abilities and several other perceptive features. Here is a detailed description of Solarix Stealth A.I and its relation with the game-play mechanics: Solarix is a stealth game, and you can either use \"stealth-based combat\" or you can even finish the game without firing a bullet but knocking everyone out or you can even finish the game without alerting anyone. If you like stealth kills, explore for ammo, use your pistol carefully(=combat) and aim for headshots and move around... If you want to knock out enemies, don\\'t use your pistol, use your tazer, observe their patrol points and knock them out one by one... If you want to create your own darkness, use your pistol on lights, not on enemies... If you want to \"ghost\" the entire game that is also possible, but you\\'ll have to keep an eye your light meter and environment all the time... If you want to lure enemies around, use throwable objects, not any weapons... If you are around monsters and get caught, use your pistol to defend yourself until you find some cover/hiding spot... Further in the game, if you are bored of sneaking around, use your shotgun to blast enemies, but you have to explore around carefully to collect ammo first... Unique puzzles in that require exploration and information gathering in classic adventure style. Wide variety in environments...In Solarix, you\\'ll travel from cramped corridors to vast exotic forests to giant space stations to ominous underground facilities. Each level has its own strategy; each strategy is created by you. Some levels you\\'ll have to run away from monsters, in some levels you\\'ll want to directly confront them. One level will require you explore around in classical-adventure style to solve puzzles, whereas another level will require you to sneak around carefully. Rich in-game content – you’ll encounter not just human enemies and monsters but you’ll have to hack your way through turrets, security cameras, sniper-robots and flying drones. There is a different and unique type of enemy awaiting you around every corner. Professional voice acting providing lots of depth to background ',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content Shilovo 1942 is an addon for Graviteam Tactics: Operation Star, which adds new summer area of operations near the Shilovo village (Voronezh front) and 2 new operations for the Red Army and Wehrmacht in July 1942, 13 turns. Combat mission: Intending to enter Voronezh from the South, on July 4, 1942, attacking German forces partly crossed the river Don at Petino – Malyshevo. Bitter fighting quickly ensued over possession of the Shilovo bridgehead, as neither side wanted to lose this strategically important asset. The bridgehead provided the shortest route across the river Don at Malyshevo, terminating in the Southern outskirts of Voronezh on the right bank of the river. German forces intended to use the right bank in their drive to Stalingrad. Hitler was later to declare delays advancing through this region contributed to the failure at Stalingrad, having given Soviet forces more time to prepare. The Shilovo forest presented ideal opportunities for the concealed deployment of reserve forces. It masked warehouses, logistical assets & accommodations. Shilovo, located on high ground, held a dominant position on the left bank. From the village and especially from the church bell-tower, the disposition of Soviet defensive forces at Maslovka, Tavrovo, and Beryozovka was clearly visible, even without field glasses. In-game engagements are modelled for the period from July 4 to July 6, 1942. The battle (on the map modeled in the game) was fought by: German 24th Pz. Div. (26th Inf. Regt., 24th Inf. Regt.) with reinforcements, and Soviet 232 Rifle Div. (498 Rifle Regt., 425 Art. Regt.), 110 Tank Bde and a battalion of 180 Tank Bde (last is unconfirmed). Elements of the 24th Pz. Div. had begun crossing the Don on the morning of 4th July. Initially only lightly armed units made the crossing, moving towards Voronezh. Heavy equipment and artillery followed only on 5th July. On the morning of 5th July the German forces were unsuccessfully counter-attacked by tanks of 110 and 180 Tank Bde. German forces defeated elements of the 232nd Rifle Div. and took control of Shilovo. Germans noted the strong influence of Soviet air support. New content: New area near Voronezh, village Shilovo, 80 sq.km wide. Two new operations at the beginning of July 1942, one for the Red Army, one for the Wehrmacht. Troops: Wehrmacht - 24 Pz (one batallion from 21, 26 Inf Reg and 24 Pz Reg); Red Army - 2,3/498 Rifle Reg, 2 coys from practice battalion of 232 Rifle Div, 441 Tank Bn from 110 Tank Bde, 1/425 Arty Reg, parts of 16 Destr Bde and platoon from 180 Tank Bde, 1/687 Rifle Reg from 141 Rifle Div.

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content In all of America railroading’s long history, no event was greater or more enthralling than the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. And now the transcontinental railroad, along with all its steam-era, “Old West” appeal and challenges, comes to Train Simulator with Smokebox’s extraordinary Promontory Summit route! In the 1860s, the Central Pacific (later to become the Southern Pacific) and Union Pacific built east from Sacramento and west from Omaha respectively, with each road energized by the promise of financial rewards and government land grants based upon the miles of road they each constructed. In April 1869 it was agreed that the point of bonding of America’s transcontinental rails would be at the summit of Utah’s Promontory Range. And thus, at 12:47 p.m. on May 10, 1869, the Central Pacific and Union Pacific rails were joined with the historic “Golden Spike” ceremony, with Union Pacific 4-4-0 No. 119 and Central Pacific’s “Jupiter” standing pilot-to-pilot at Promontory Summit. The Train Simulator Promontory Summit route re-creates the historic stage over which this remarkable railroad drama occurred, with 68 route miles extending from Corinne, Utah over Promontory Summit and along the north shore of the Great Salt Lake to Kelton, Utah. Set in 1869, the route is a remarkable Train Simulator re-creation of 19th century American railroading and its “Old West” environment. Rugged, remote topography, tough grades, spindly trestles, and the rough-and-tumble “tent towns” that dotted the newly constructed transcontinental line all come to enthralling life in the Smokebox route. Centered on Promontory Summit, the route includes segments of the railroad as originally operated by Central Pacific and Union Pacific, and thus provides a perfect and authentic setting to put Smokebox’s popular period steam power – which includes Central Pacific’s 4-4-0 “Jupiter,” CP’s 4-6-0 “Buffalo,” and Union Pacific’s 4-4-0 No. 119 types (all available separately) – to work toting passengers and freight. Along with the beautifully crafted route, this Add-On includes ten career scenarios and three free-roam scenarios in which you can go to work at the throttle of CP and UP vintage steam power. And among the career scenarios are two scenarios which together provide an end-to-end “guided tour” of the route and its legendary history!  Included Scenarios Ten captivating and challenging career scenarios for the Promontory Summit route are included as well as three free roam scenarios. C01. Guided Tour – Corinne to Promontory C02.

Participate in the breathtaking adventure to uncover the true nature of the Relic, and save your world. Visit various places, from the green forests to forgotten ruins and floating isles, swirling with wild magic. Meet unexpected allies and face deadly challenges. Claim mighty artifacts and magic powers to create your own combat style. Features: Four acts filled with various enemies, trials, and rewards. Your adventure includes not only dynamic battles but also some text-based encounters and occasions. Each adventure is unique: participate in many different events during your travel, from caravan robbing to artifact-hunting in forgotten mage towers. Use the power of mysterious Relic to change the Fate into your favor. But beware - this power comes with a price! Unique combat styles: use various magic spells to obliterate your enemies, clad yourself in impenetrable armor or rain a hail of arrows on your enemies! Extreme variety of equipment: reflect hostile magic with your mirror shield, drain life force from your enemies with a vampire sword, or challenge them to duel by throwing a gauntlet to their faces! Combine different abilities to create your own playstyle: the trap can zap your enemies with the chain lightning, while the lightning will teleport you to your next victim! Use environment: focus not only on your own abilities but also on your surroundings. Magic crystals and terrain features can create a huge advantage in combat. Or doom you as well. Game changes each run: the adventure is randomized and you can unlock new items and abilities by making achievements and participating in unique events! ',\n",

Get up to 100k score each and every game to progress faster and get your place on the top 50 scoreboard!  Single Player Start a game and try to hit the hornets. When you are succesefull they fall on the floor and than you can go and pick them up. You can see the hornet counter on the bottom of the screen. Try to catch as many as possible without dying and take them to the collecting area and set your score. More hornets you collect at once more bonus you recive 1=1, 10=100, 100=100000 You need a minimum of 500 points each game to keep your rank status frozen. The challenge is to bring 100 hornets at once to the collector and be awarded with 100000 bonus points. At the end of the game your score will be showed on the LeaderBoard and you can see your rank in the main menu.  Multiplayer work in progress...you can connect with your friends and play against each other (10 players max) or cooperate and catch as many hornets you can.....in progress: lag, matchmaking, mods,...  The CrazyHousePlanes are equipped with three types of weapons. The main source of damage is your faithful machine gun, always ready to burn down your foes..well, almost always, you might want to throw an eye on your ammo count every now and then. Your heavy duty damage output comes from the homing missile launcher, lock your targets when you keep them in your crosshair for a short period of time - the lock-on is indicated by a sound. The third, situational weapon are the rear bombs. Rear bombs are best used against those enemies who don't keep their flying safety distance in check, giving you a proper defense. As this weapon is only meant to be a defensive weapon, it does not increase kill count.  The game can be played in 1st person or 3rd person. After each game, the players are rewarded with trophies.\",\n",

Description Hayato lived an ordinary life until he wakes up one day with amnesia… and finds himself in a world closer to the video games he plays than the world he remembers. Fetch quests? Skill points? Respawning after death? It’s all a bit much to accept. A mage named Shiori offers to help him find his way, and with her help, he learns how to fight monsters, perform fetch quests, and put items in a strange metaphysical space called an “inventory.” Soon he’s ready to take on NPC quests! But the town of Lightshire is in danger from deadly monsters—monsters that can kill you for real. Where did they come from? What is behind the attacks? Hayato and Shiori are determined to find out, and no matter what they encounter—from high-level dungeons to argumentative party members—they won’t stop until they learn the truth. Features Parody of traditional JRPG and MMORPG tropes. Immersive fantasy world filled with monsters and memorable characters. Numerous distinct environments, including a haunted library, a mad scientist’s laboratory, and an eldritch temple. Lighthearted and humorous atmosphere. Three possible romance routes. Three main endings based on your choices. ',\n",

It is designed to offer each player the most choice possible in whether to support the game or not. Since Steam doesn\\'t support \"pay-what-you-liked\" or \"pay-what-you-want\" remuneration systems, the DLC acts as a stand-in to offer multiple suggested tiers of support.

Well-fed with seed, your ostrich will lay eggs which can then be sold to the Shopkeeper. With this money, you can buy new animals at the Farmers’ Market. So, the aim of the game is to increase your money counter by selling eggs and other farm produce, so as to buy more livestock at the Farmers’ Market and purchase equipment for your farm from the Shopkeeper. Little by little as your farm builds up, you will unlock certain bonuses: a wind turbine, a totem, a guard dog, a jeep, a barbecue, etc.',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game Jump into the role of a star and experience a new type of social gameplay! Velvet Sundown is a social multiplayer role-playing game, taking place on a luxury yacht cruising the waters of a fictitious Caribbean state of Balbonia. Embark on a journey full of conspiracies, trickery and secrets where you can never tell a friend from foe. In the beginning of each game you are assigned one of the 11 readymade characters at random. Each character has their own unique agenda to pursue, as well as a randomized goal to strive for. Fulfilling your objectives might not be as easy as it seems though: as everyone else has their own secrets, some of the people aboard might not be as willing to co-operate as you would like. It is up to you to use your cunning, wits and social skills to get what you want and avoid spilling your own secrets. The scenarios are always multiplayer and require a minimum of 4 players, which means that every character you see is played by a real person. This also means completing quests always requires freeform chatting and interaction with the other characters. Velvet Sundown is based on the Dramagame engine developed by the Finnish game developer Tribe Studios Ltd. Key Features The first entertainment title ever to use revolutionary Dramagame mechanics and technology Endless replayability: players' actions affect how each scenario plays out, so every session is truly unique Uses high-quality text-to-speech technology by Acapela to enhance immersion No grinding, no killing, no looting – just 100% pure role-playing \",\n",

Explore a hostile alien landscape, or design with creative freedom. The choice is yours. Start your career as an Intergalactic miner on a randomly generated infinite world in search of profit and glory in Campaign, sit back and build to your hearts content in Creative mode or pit your Techs against the clock and dare to run the Gauntlet Challenge. There are many game modes available in TerraTech to stretch your Tech building imagination to the limits! Story In the distant future, Earth's natural resources have been depleted, and as a resource-gathering prospector it's your job to travel to alien planets and scour them for valuable materials. But you are not alone! Rival prospectors litter the landscapes of these new worlds, and will fight to protect what’s theirs, and invade to take what’s yours. To make your mark, you will need to be cunning and creative. Using the building blocks, guns, wheels, and wings from several Mining Corporations, you can build varied Techs to suit every purpose. Be it powerful armoured combat vehicles, unstoppable resource gathering machines, sprawling resource processing bases or a hybrid of all three - creativity is your key to exo-planetary success. The worlds in TerraTech are procedurally generated and infinite, so there are always new lands to discover and more resources to find. Treacherous mountain ranges, luscious grasslands and huge deserts are among the biomes you will encounter. More will be added as development progresses. The intergalactic mining industry is a profitable one, but you are not the only miner in search for new worlds to exploit. Defending yourself from rival miners will take time, resources and skill, with success leading to new territory and new lands. All equipable blocks and items can be damaged or destroyed, so ensuring you are sufficiently armed and ready for battle is a key element of both survival and prosperity in TerraTech. Get out there and show them who’s boss! By gathering and processing natural resources, players are able to construct storage, refining and construction bases in order to craft new blocks in the game. Like the look of that Venture Hail Fire Rifle that just tore your vehicle apart? Go prospecting for the needed resources, and craft a couple for yourself in the shiny new Venture fabricator which you just aquired, by beating their time trial challenge in the nearby mountains. All exo-planetary miners buy parts from the established Mining Corporations, which each have their own specific brand of mining technology. Get the job done with GSO, zoom around with high-performance recon specialists Venture, strip-mine to the max with the heavy-duty GeoCorp or act with miltary efficiency utilizing the stealth focussed Hawkeye. New Corporations we’re aiming to add to the game include deranged experimental scientists Reticule Research, technological superiority giants Better Future and the hive-mind AI swarms of LEGION. Completing missions and discovering blocks for each Corp will improve your standing with them, and gain access to the more sought-after components in their arsenal. This is an Early Access game, with everything that implies. Please check the System Requirements to ensure your PC is compatible. \",\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Game  The Butterfly Sign: Human Error is the second chapter of the first person detective video game in which we are playing as a sole survivor of a serious terrorist attack. Protagonist is the only witness of the incident and his fate depends on his memories. That’s why he goes in for a desperate measure: he takes the experimental medication called “Rammex”, which immerses him in the depths of his mind and makes him accurately recollect a chain of events, which had happened. While wandering through his own memories, the protagonist has to look for evidences and learn bits and pieces to find the guilty persons… The main feature of the second chapter of the game is the concept of multilevel memories. Drug effect of Rammex makes the protagonist remember everything he has ever known, while maintaining freedom of action and choice inside his memories. This means that if the protagonist finds the device with Rammex in his memories, then theoretically he may use it… The second distinctive feature of this episode is the spatial confusion inside the memories or, put simply, looped space. Some of the memories will cause errors in memory, thus creating looped space: while trying to leave the location by all means, the protagonist will make it into it again and again and so on ad infinitum. You will have to put your thinking cap on in order to solve this puzzle, to break the loop and to get out. Explore Memority hospital and its premises, learn its secrets and restore the chain of events that took place here. Solve the puzzles and murders committed at Memority. Find clues, compare the facts and avoid tricky obstacles in your way. Penetrate into the new, previously inaccessible memories. Make conclusions and choose the correct route, because all your decisions affect the outcome of the game and influence the fact whether you can get to the truth. Thuth that was lost in your own mind… - Excellent graphics achieved with Unreal Engine 4 – the most advanced game engine in the world.  We used photogrammetry technology and high-resolution textures to create the world of The Butterfly Sign as beautiful as possible. - Non-linear dialogues and the ability to make choices which will affect the course of the story and the ending. The progress of the dialogue always depends on your location. And you always have the opportunity to make choices, sometimes insignificant, sometimes important for the further story. - Brainstorm your head with investigation of murders, puzzles and mysteries. The Butterfly Sign develops the player’s skills of criminology and deduction. For those players who prefer the story, there is always the easiest difficulty level, but if you are really up to the true detective, you have a variety of other levels, including the hardest one causing the game restart after a single death. - In The Butterfly Sign, the events take place in the past and in the present simultaneously. - The atmospheric sound.  We have paid a great attention to sound effects in The Butterfly Sign. Every lamp, every water drop falling from the ceiling has its own sound. Each room boasts of its own unique ambience corresponding to its style and mood. The action takes place in present. The protagonist, Jack, was found not far from Memority hospital, where an experimental drug called Rammex had been developed. It was created to help patients recover their memories. But the hospital was attacked. The drug was stolen, and all the staff and patients were killed. Explosion and conflagration destroyed a part of the hospital. And Jack was the only survivor. As a result of a strong explosion, Jack lost some of his memory, he remembers only small fragments of what have happened. Jack is helped by Dr. Romanov – the chief scientist of Memority hospital and the mastermind behind the drug. During the whole game, the protagonist will be staying in a hospital bed, and all the gameplay will occur in his memories restored with Rammex. The game world is divided into two parts: the real world, where the hero is confined to a hospital bed, and the world of his memories, where he will spend most of his time. The Butterfly Sign also has non-linear dialogues, and all your decisions will affect the outcome of the story at the very end. Necessary Evil The Butterfly Sign is divided into three chapters. In the first chapter, Jack, walking through the alley of his own memory, becomes the eyes and ears of Dr. Romanov. The drug \"Rammex\" helps him do it. The main character tries to recover the fragments of his memory in order to find the ones responsible for the attack on Memority. Hovewer, the further he goes, the more he realizes that everything that happened was the necessary evil... Human Error Memority had been developing \"Rammex\" to help sick patients recover their lost memory. According to the Memority scientists, \"Rammex\" was able to quickly restore human nerve cells. It would have been a real revolution in medicine, a cure for many illnesses. But turning over the pages of his own mind and investigating the incident, Jack begins to realize how unreal his world is, and what a beautiful lie all this is... Wreck of my Warship In the end, to find the one responsible for the attack on Memority, Jack has to collect all the pieces of his memory together. He goes to the dam, where he last saw the mercenaries, but instead finds only one person who jumps down from the dam trying to commit suicide. Realizing that he has already been there, and the answer is in his head, Jack follows the self-murderer and jumps, because it’s the only chance to remember ... ',\n",

       "  'game_description': ' About This Content  Mythic Monsters 24: Masters of Chaos Mythic Masters of Chaos brings you an assortment of the unexpected and unstable, creatures whose very essence and nature bespeak fluidity and change. Their origins lie in the planes of chaos, though many of them wander throughout reality wherever their mood and the ebb and flow of the tides of the universe take them. You have the primordial proteans, creator-serpents that swim-slither through Limbo, from the reality-reshaping keketars to the brutal naunets, the clever and creative imenetesh and their diminutive messengers and familiars, the voidworms. The indescribable chaos beast is eternally in flux, yet perfected and inviolate in its endless variability and dragging all that touch it into chaotic communion of the flesh and mind. Some avatars of chaos are more benevolent, like the friendly lyrakien and their mightier azata cousins, the wandering knight-errant bralani, the master-musician lillends, and the haughtily radiant ghaele. Some chaos-creatures seem at first glance little more than beasts, though the sizzlingly swift pard, the hulking ironclad zentragt, and valorous freedom-loving cayhounds are far more cunning than they appear. To this collection of chaos from CR 3 to 21 we add the tragic crassodov, wolfen warriors bred for an ancient war that was never their own and that destroyed their world, casting them beyond the rifts into foreign worlds where their anarchic axes hew all who would seek to master them. Add to these fabulous foes a delightful bit of fiction examining the nature of chaos by a man who knows more about Pathfinder planar cosmology than anyone, the terrific Todd Stewart! The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they’ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and “What was THAT?” will warm any GM’s heart. Download this mythic monster supplement today, and look forward to future releases in the Mythic Monsters line. Conversion by: Jay Scheponik Released on March 04, 2018. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 3.3.4 and higher. Requirements: An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the included Pathfinder ruleset.',\n",

       "  'game_description': \" About This Game In Safe House, step into a top-secret spy headquarters situated in the fictional African nation of Kazataire. As the Safe House manager, you must build and upgrade the rooms – which will grant you new abilities and operations. You’ll also be tasked with generating revenue each day by completing various espionage activities ranging from breaking codes to forging IDs. But secret agents don’t work alone. As a behind-the scenes director of a shadowy political conflict, you will recruit, train, and deploy spies and soldiers, shaping the events of the game’s non-linear story. Will you complete your mission – regardless of the cost? Can your allegiances be bought and sold? In the shadows, it's difficult to tell friend from foe. Run, construct, and manage your own top-secret spy headquarters. Devise and solve a variety of spy-themed puzzles – such as decoding scrambled messages, forging documents, and exchanging secret phrases. Embark on a non-linear story campaign and unlock multiple endings dependent on player choice. Play your way in ‘Endless’ mode. Immerse yourself in a retro art style that evokes classic spy films of the ‘60s. \",\n",

Maps are seeded with Pigment creatures which grow larger over time like bacteria in a pitri dish, filling their inside area with maze walls. Pigments bump up against each other, punch doors through to the other side and hide keys inside the bodies of their neighbors. Classic Mode In Classic Mode, you play as an agent of White and are tasked with bringing light to the Black Tower, which is hidden and locked away somewhere on the same map. You must find keys to unlock the doors barring your way, break into the domains of your neighbors, exploring to steal their seeds to unlock the Black Tower. Along the way, you can find items to assist you in your exploration as well as ingredients to build new maps with large and more complex mazes.',\n",
