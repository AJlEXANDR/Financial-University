The current code can be found <a href=\"http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py\">here</a>.</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23][\\'episodename\\'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1<br></code></pre>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>What is the \"best\" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = \"something\"</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = \"something\"</code></p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn\\'t raise the season_not_found exception)</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>Currently it\\'s using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code></p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it\\'s self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>The problem now is it\\'s presenting itself as a dict, but doesn\\'t have all the functionality, and because I\\'m overriding the <em>_getitem_</em> and <em>_setitem_</em> functions, it\\'s easy to accidently recursively call <em>_getitem_</em> (so I\\'m not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no][\\'attribute\\'] = \\'something\\'</code>). See _setItem and _setData. It\\'s not too bad, since it\\'s currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it\\'s hardly.. elegant..</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the ShowContainer/etc classes with Dict cause problems?</p>'),\n",

So switching from C to Python for more complex things that don't require tons of speed has been more of a boon than a bane in writing projects.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>However, coming from this land of brackets and parentheses and structs as far as the naked eye can see, I come across a small problem: I find Python difficult to read.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>For example, the following block of text is hard for me to decipher unless I stare at it (which I dislike doing):</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>if foo:\\\\n   bar = baz\\\\n   while bar not biz:\\\\n      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()\\\\n\\\\ndid_i_not_warn_you_biz()\\\\nmy_father_is_avenged()\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The problem occurs at the end of that if block: all the tabbing and then suddenly returning to a jarring block feels almost disturbing.

I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.

       "  'Testing GUI code: should I use a mocking library?',\n",
       "  '<p>Recently I\\'ve been experimenting with TDD while developing a GUI application in Python. I find it very reassuring to have tests that verify the functionality of my code, but it\\'s been tricky to follow some of the recommened practices of TDD. Namely, writing tests first has been hard. And I\\'m finding it difficult to make my tests readable (due to extensive use of a mocking library).</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I chose a mocking library called <a href=\"http://labix.org/mocker\" rel=\"nofollow\">mocker</a>. I use it a lot since much of the code I\\'m testing makes calls to (a) other methods in my application that depend on system state or (b) ObjC/Cocoa objects that cannot exist without an event loop, etc.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Anyway, I\\'ve got a lot of tests that look like this:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>def test_current_window_controller():\\\\n    def test(config):\\\\n        ac = AppController()\\\\n        m = Mocker()\\\\n        ac.iter_window_controllers = iwc = m.replace(ac.iter_window_controllers)\\\\n        expect(iwc()).result(iter(config))\\\\n        with m:\\\\n            result = ac.current_window_controller()\\\\n            assert result == (config[0] if config else None)\\\\n    yield test, []\\\\n    yield test, [0]\\\\n    yield test, [1, 0]\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Notice that this is actually three tests; all use the same parameterized test function. Here\\'s the code that is being tested:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>def current_window_controller(self):\\\\n    try:\\\\n        # iter_window_controllers() iterates in z-order starting\\\\n        # with the controller of the top-most window\\\\n        # assumption: the top-most window is the \"current\" one\\\\n        wc = self.iter_window_controllers().next()\\\\n    except StopIteration:\\\\n        return None\\\\n    return wc\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>One of the things I\\'ve noticed with using mocker is that it\\'s easier to write the application code first and then go back and write the tests second, since most of the time I\\'m mocking many method calls and the syntax to write the mocked calls is much more verbose (thus harder to write) than the application code. It\\'s easier to write the app code and then model the test code off of that.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I find that with this testing method (and a bit of discipline) I can easily write code with 100% test coverage.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I\\'m wondering if these tests are good tests? Will I regret doing it this way down the road when I finally discover the secret to writing good tests?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Am I violating the core principles of TDD so much that my testing is in vain?</p>\\\\n'),\n",

We are in agreement that our backend (framework if you will) is out dated and doesn't provide us with the proper tools to move forward in a quick manner. We have pretty much embraced the current webMVC pattern that is all over the place, and cannot do it, in a reasonable manner, with the current technology. The big missing features are proper dispatching and templating with inheritance, amongst others.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Currently there are two paths being discussed:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<ol>\\\\n<li>Port the existing application to Classic ASP using JScript, which will allow us to hopefully go from there to .NET MSJscript without too much trouble, and eventually end up on the .NET platform (preferably the MVC stuff will be done by then, ASP.NET isn't much better than were we are on now, in our opinions). This has been argued as the safer path with less risk than the next option, albeit it might take slightly longer.</li>\\\\n<li>Completely rewrite the application using some other technology, right now the leader of the pack is Python WSGI with a custom framework, ORM, and a good templating solution. There is wiggle room here for even django and other pre-built solutions. This method would hopefully be the quickest solution, as we would probably run a beta beside the actual product, but it does have the potential for a big waste of time if we can't/don't get it right.</li>\\\\n</ol>\\\\n\\\\n<p>This does not mean that our logic is gone, as what we have built over the years is fairly stable, as noted just difficult to deal with.

Has anyone taken either of the two paths above? If so, was it successful, how could it have been better, etc. We aren't looking to deviate much from doing one of those two things, but some suggestions or other solutions would potentially be helpful.</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

It goes through the Scroll object, which transforms the tool's snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position, here's the code:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>#in Tool\\\\ndef render(self, screen):\\\\n    Scroll.render(screen, self.image, self.snappedPos)\\\\n\\\\n#in Scroll\\\\ndef render(self, screen, image, odePos):\\\\n    pixelPos = self.odePosToPixelPos(odePos)\\\\n    screen.blit(image, pixelPos) # screen is a surface from pygame for the curious\\\\n\\\\ndef odePosToPixelPos(self.odePos):\\\\n    offsetPos = odePos + self.viewPortOffset\\\\n    return odeToPixels(offsetPos)\\\\n\\\\ndef odeToPixels(odeUnits):\\\\n    return int(odeUnits * pixels_in_an_ode_unit)\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Whew, that was a long explanation.  Hope you're still with me... </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The problem I'm now getting is that when I scroll up the drawn image loses alignment with the cursor.<br />\\\\nIt starts snapping to the Y step exactly 1 step below the cursor.\\\\nAdditionally it appears to phase in and out of allignment.<br />\\\\nAt some scrolls it is out by 1 and other scrolls it is spot on.<br />\\\\nIt's never out by more than 1 and it's always snapping to a valid grid location.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Best guess I can come up with is that somewhere I'm truncating some data in the wrong spot, but no idea where or how it ends up with this behavior.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Anyone familiar with coordinate spaces, scrolling and snapping?</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

       "  '<p>I have a list of data in the following form:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><code>[(id\\\\__1_, description, id\\\\_type), (id\\\\__2_, description, id\\\\_type), ... , (id\\\\__n_, description, id\\\\_type))</code></p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The data are loaded from files that belong to the same group. In each group there could be multiples of the same id, each coming from different files. I don\\'t care about the duplicates, so I thought that a nice way to store all of this would be to throw it into a Set type. But there\\'s a problem.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Sometimes for the same id the descriptions can vary slightly, as follows:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>IPI00110753</p>\\\\n\\\\n<ul>\\\\n<li>Tubulin alpha-1A chain</li>\\\\n<li>Tubulin alpha-1 chain</li>\\\\n<li>Alpha-tubulin 1</li>\\\\n<li>Alpha-tubulin isotype M-alpha-1</li>\\\\n</ul>\\\\n\\\\n<p>(Note that this example is taken from the <a href=\"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P68369\" rel=\"nofollow\">uniprot protein database</a>.) </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I don\\'t care if the descriptions vary. I cannot throw them away because there is a chance that the protein database I am using will not contain a listing for a certain identifier. If this happens I will want to be able to display the human readable description to the biologists so they know roughly what protein they are looking at.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I am currently solving this problem by using a dictionary type. However I don\\'t really like this solution because it uses a lot of memory (I have a lot of these ID\\'s). This is only an intermediary listing of them. There is some additional processing the ID\\'s go through before they are placed in the database so I would like to keep my data-structure smaller.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I have two questions really. First, will I get a smaller memory footprint using the Set type (over the dictionary type) for this, or should I use a sorted list where I check every time I insert into the list to see if the ID exists, or is there a third solution that I haven\\'t thought of? Second, if the Set type is the better answer how do I key it to look at just the first element of the tuple instead of the whole thing? </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Thank you for reading my question, <br>\\\\nTim</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>based on some of the comments I received let me clarify a little. Most of what I do with data-structure is insert into it. I only read it twice, once to annotate it with additional information,* and once to do be inserted into the database. However down the line there may be additional annotation that is done before I insert into the database. Unfortunately I don\\'t know if that will happen at this time. </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Right now I am looking into storing this data in a structure that is not based on a hash-table (ie. a dictionary). I would like the new structure to be fairly quick on insertion, but reading it can be linear since I only really do it twice. I am trying to move away from the hash table to save space. Is there a better structure or is a hash-table about as good as it gets?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>*The information is a list of Swiss-Prot protein identifiers that I get by querying uniprot.</p>\\\\n'),\n",

The language needs to be capable of simple expression evaluation, as well as querying table indexes and iterating through the returned rows.

I'd also prefer not to have to write an entire query optimiser, so something that explicitly specifies what indexes to query would be ideal.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The interface that this will have to compile against will be similar in capabilities to what the App Engine datastore exports: You can query for sequential ranges on any index on the table (eg, less-than, greater-than, range and equality queries), then filter the returned row by any boolean expression.

However, if the user's locale differs from the default C locale, any files that are subsequently loaded will return incorrect data, presumably because all string-to-float conversion has been affected, right down to the metal.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>We can't work around this by implementing locale aware file loading, so our current workaround is to only set the locale when formatting output for the user, and then set it back again afterwards. That is, something like:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>import locale\\\\ncurrentLocale = locale.getLocale( locale.LC_ALL )\\\\nlocale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )\\\\ndisplayNumbersToTheUser()\\\\nlocale.setlocale( locale.LC_ALL, currentLocale )\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>This seems a bit clunky, and I was wondering whether this is a common approach to formatting locale-aware output for the user? My other concern is that this is obviously not thread safe, so we'll presumably still get problems if any file parsing occurs in a separate thread when the locale is changed.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Any information on best practice is appreciated - I don't have much experience with this sort of thing.</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

The signature will still not be shown properly in automatically generated documentation. It\\'s easy to update the function and forget about changing the docstring, or to make a typo. [<i>And yes, I\\'m aware of the fact that the docstring already duplicates the function body. Please ignore this; funny_function is just a random example.</i>]</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>2 -- Not use a decorator, or use a special-purpose decorator for every specific signature:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>def funny_functions_decorator(f):\\\\n    def g(x, y, z=3):\\\\n        return f(int(x), int(y), z=int(z))\\\\n    g.__name__ = f.__name__\\\\n    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__\\\\n    return g\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>This works fine for a set of functions that have identical signature, but it\\'s useless in general. As I said in the beginning, I want to be able to use decorators entirely generically.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I\\'m looking for a solution that is fully general, and automatic.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>So the question is: is there a way to edit the decorated function signature after it has been created?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Otherwise, can I write a decorator that extracts the function signature and uses that information instead of \"*kwargs, **kwargs\" when constructing the decorated function?

In fact, one of the biggest thorns in our side has been getting some of these extensions compiled against appropriate versions of the shared libraries so as to avoid segfaults, malloc errors and all sorts of similar issues.

I guess that what I should be doing is putting each reusable component of my system into a separate egg, and then using buildout to assemble them into projects.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I'm also thinking that for any particular module, I should put the unit-tests into a separate package or egg, so that I'm not also installing copies of the component's  unit-tests in every project. I only want to unit-test in a place where my library is developed, not where it's just being used.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>So maybe I want something like this</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>projects\\\\n  lib1\\\\n    tests\\\\n    code\\\\n  lib2\\\\n    tests\\\\n    code\\\\n  app1\\\\n    tests \\\\n    appcode\\\\n  app2\\\\n    tests\\\\n    appcode\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>etc.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Where both app1 and app2 are independent applications with their own code and tests, but are also including and using both lib1 and lib2.

I assume that when I develop app1, I want buildout to pull copies of lib1, lib2 and app1 into a separate working directory rather than put copies of these libraries under app1 directly. But how does this work with my SVN source-control? If the working directory is dynamically constructed with buildout, it can't be a live SVN directory from which I can check the changes back into the repository?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Have I misunderstood how buildout is meant to be used? Would I be better going for a completely different approach? How do you mix source-control with module-reuse between projects?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Update : thanks to the two people who've currently answered this question.

       "  \"<p>I've been wondering about how hard it would be to write some Python code to search a string for the index of a substring of the form <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code>, for example, where <em>expr</em> is meant to be a Python expression or something resembling one.  Given such a thing, one could easily imagine going on to check the expression's syntax with <code>compile()</code>, evaluate it against a particular scope with <code>eval()</code>, and perhaps even substitute the result into the original string.  People must do very similar things all the time.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I could imagine solving such a problem using a third-party parser generator [oof], or by hand-coding some sort of state machine [eek], or perhaps by convincing Python's own parser to do the heavy lifting somehow [hmm].  Maybe there's a third-party templating library somewhere that can be made to do exactly this.  Maybe restricting the syntax of <em>expr</em> is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example, maybe all I really need is something that matches any <em>expr</em> that has balanced curly braces.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>What's your sense?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<h2>Update:</h2>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Thanks very much for your responses so far!  Looking back at what I wrote yesterday, I'm not sure I was sufficiently clear about what I'm asking.  Template substitution is indeed an interesting problem, and probably much more useful to many more people than the expression extraction subproblem I'm wondering about, but I brought it up only as a simple example of how the answer to my question might be useful in real life.  Some other potential applications might include passing the extracted expressions to a syntax highlighter; passing the result to a real Python parser and looking at or monkeying with the parse tree; or using the sequence of extracted expressions to build up a larger Python program, perhaps in conjunction with some information taken from the surrounding text.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code> syntax I mentioned is also intended as an example, and in fact I wonder if I shouldn't have used <code>$(</code><em>expr</em><code>)</code> as my example instead, because it makes the potential drawbacks of the obvious approach, along the lines of <code>re.finditer(r'$\\\\{([^}]+)\\\\}', s)</code>, a bit easier to see.  Python expressions can (and often do) contain the <code>)</code> (or <code>}</code>) character.  It seems possible that handling any of those cases might be much more trouble than it's worth, but I'm not convinced of that yet.  Please feel free to try to make this case!</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Prior to posting this question, I spent quite a bit of time looking at Python template engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low-level functionality I'm asking about -- namely, something that can find expressions in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expressions embedded using a single hard-coded syntax, always evaluating them, and always substituting the results back into the original string.  I haven't figured out how to use any of them to solve my problem yet, but I do very much appreciate the suggestions regarding more to look at (can't believe I missed that wonderful list on the wiki!).  The API documentation for these things tends to be pretty high-level, and I'm not too familiar with the internals of any of them, so I'm sure I could use help looking at those and figuring out how to get them to do this sort of thing.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Thanks for your patience!</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

Counting down I knew that in the data rows I would need to get the values in columns [3, 7, 11, 15].  So I set out to accomplish that using this code:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>indexComment = souptoGetColIndex.findAll(text=re.compile(\"type=body\"))\\\\nindexRow=indexComment[0].findParent()\\\\nindexCells=indexRow.findAll(text=re.compile(\"type=body\"))\\\\nfor each in range(len(indexCells)):\\\\n    collist.append(tdlist.index(indexCells[each].previousSibling.previousSibling))\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>what I got back was collist=[0, 3, 7, 7, 15]</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>It turns out I think that because cells in the 7th and 11th position looked exactly alike the same index position was returned.  I was trying to figure out how to deal with this, clearly I had to make them look different.  So what I did was make them look different by first using a readlines to read each line of the file in and change the blank spaces to a random integer.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>for each in toGetColIndex:\\\\n   newlt.append(each.replace(r\"&amp;nbsp;\",str(random.randint(1,14567))))\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>a friend pointed out that I could lower overhead by using this instead</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>for each in toGetColIndex:\\\\n   newlt.append(each.replace(r\"&amp;nbsp;\",str(toGetColIndex.index(each))))\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Nonetheless, each of these approaches gets me a list with the colindex for the location of my headers for each column and to use on the data rows.  Note that replace function is missing the blank space since I guess the html is causing it to disappear the actual code uses r\"&amp;.n.b.s.p;\" without the periods</p>\\\\n'),\n",

       "  \"<p>I am working on a desktop application in PyGTK and seem to be bumping up against some limitations of my file organization.  Thus far I've structured my project this way:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<ul>\\\\n<li>application.py - holds the primary application class (most functional routines)</li>\\\\n<li>gui.py - holds a loosely coupled GTK gui implementation.  Handles signal callbacks, etc.</li>\\\\n<li>command.py - holds command line automation functions not dependent on data in the application class</li>\\\\n<li>state.py - holds the state data persistence class</li>\\\\n</ul>\\\\n\\\\n<p>This has served fairly well so far, but at this point application.py is starting to get rather long.  I have looked at numerous other PyGTK applications and they seem to have similar structural issues.  At a certain point the primary module starts to get very long and there is not obvious way of breaking the code out into narrower modules without sacrificing clarity and object orientation.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I have considered making the GUI the primary module and having seperate modules for the toolbar routines, the menus routines, etc, but at that point I believe I will lose most of the benefits of OOP and end up with an everything-references-everything scenario.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Should I just deal with having a very long central module or is there a better way of structuring the project so that I don't have to rely on the class browser so much?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><strong>EDIT I</strong></p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Ok, so point taken regarding all the MVC stuff.  I do have a rough approximation of MVC in my code, but admittedly I could probably gain some mileage by further segregating the model and controller.  However, I am reading over python-gtkmvc's documentation (which is a great find by the way, thank you for referencing it) and my impression is that its not going to solve my problem so much as just formalize it.  My application is a single glade file, generally a single window. So no matter how tightly I define the MVC roles of the modules I'm still going to have one controller module doing most everything, which is pretty much what I have now. Admittedly I'm a little fuzzy on proper MVC implementation and I'm going to keep researching, but it doesn't look to me like this architecture is going to get any more stuff out of my main file, its just going to rename that file to controller.py.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Should I be thinking about separate Controller/View pairs for seperate sections of the window (the toolbar, the menus, etc)? Perhaps that is what I'm missing here.  It seems that this is what S. Lott is referring to in his second bullet point.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Thanks for the responses so far.</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

You can ask it to prettyprint the AST, using its own formatting conventions (you can changes these), or do \"fidelity printing\", which uses the original line and column information to maximally preserve the original layout (some change in layout where new code is inserted is unavoidable).</p>\\n\\n<p>To implement a \"mutation\" rule for Python with DMS, you could write the following:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>rule mutate_addition(s:sum, p:product):sum-&gt;sum =\\n  \" \\\\s + \\\\p \" -&gt; \" \\\\s - \\\\p\"\\n if mutate_this_place(s);\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This rule replace  \"+\" with \"-\" in a syntactically correct way; it operates on the AST and thus won\\'t touch strings or comments that happen to look right.  The extra condition on \"mutate_this_place\" is to let you control how often this occurs; you don\\'t want to mutate <em>every</em> place in the program.</p>\\n\\n<p>You\\'d obviously want a bunch more rules like this that detect various code structures, and replace them by the mutated versions.   DMS is happy to apply a set of rules.  The mutated AST is then prettyprinted.</p>\\n'},\n",

I can structure the data any way I would like, but clearly I would like to do everything I can to play to the strengths of having EMR run on S3 data.  </p>\\n\\n<p>My data consists of millions of web pages (each 50K, let's say).  Intuitively, it makes sense to me to create a set of .tar.gz files (.tgz for short) that each have thousands of pages, such that the .tgz file sizes are around 2GB or so.  I would like to then load these .tgz files onto S3 and write a mrjob task to process these (on, say, 10 EC2 instances). </p>\\n\\n<p>I am attracted to building these .tgz files because they represent a very compressed form of the data, and thus they should minimize network traffic (size and thus latency to transfer).  I am also attracted to building multiple .tgz files because I would obviously like to leverage the multiple EMR instances I am planning on allocating for the job. </p>\\n\\n<p>If I have to, I could concat the files so that I avoid the archive (tar) step and just deal with .gz files, but it'd be easier to just tar the original data and then compress.</p>\\n\\n<p>Am I thinking about this the right way, and if so, how can I configure/specify mrjob to decompress and un-tar such that an instance will process the entirety of just one of those .tgz files?</p>\\n\",\n",

I implemented a similar system using RabbitMQ as the message broker with durable persistent queues. The messages have even survived a crash of the RabbitMQ server software when I was using an outdated 1.72 server version on a virtual Linux server with only 512M of RAM and a million or so messages in play.</p>\\n\\n<p>The way I do it is that each type of worker consumes messages from a different queue.

This can be recreated as a dataframe as follows:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>import numpy as np\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\ntempDF = pd.DataFrame({ 'id': [0,1,2,3,4],\\n                        'date': ['0001-01-01 00:00:00.0000000',\\n                                 '2015-05-22 00:00:00.0000000',\\n                                 '0001-01-01 00:00:00.0000000',\\n                                 '2015-05-06 00:00:00.0000000',\\n                                 '2015-05-03 00:00:00.0000000']})\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The dataframe looks like:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>print(tempDF)\\n                          date  id\\n0  0001-01-01 00:00:00.0000000   0\\n1  2015-05-22 00:00:00.0000000   1\\n2  0001-01-01 00:00:00.0000000   2\\n3  2015-05-06 00:00:00.0000000   3\\n4  2015-05-03 00:00:00.0000000   4\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>... with the following dtypes:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>print(tempDF.dtypes)\\n\\ndate    object\\nid       int64\\ndtype: object\\nprint(tempDF.dtypes)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>However, I routinely convert date fields in the dataframe to datetime format using:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>tempDF['date'] = pd.to_datetime(tempDF['date'])\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>However, by chance, I've noticed that the 0001-01-01 date is converted to 2001-01-01.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>print(tempDF)\\n\\n        date  id\\n0 2001-01-01   0\\n1 2015-05-22   1\\n2 2001-01-01   2\\n3 2015-05-06   3\\n4 2015-05-03   4\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>I realise that the dates in the original database are incorrect because SQL Server doesn't see 0001-01-01 as a valid date. But at least in the 0001-01-01 format, such missing data are easy to identify within my Pandas dataframe. However, when pandas.to_datetime() changes these dates so they lie within a feasible range, it is very easy to miss such outliers.</p>\\n\\n<p>How can I make sure that pd.to_datetime doesn't interpret the outlier dates incorrectly?</p>\\n\",\n",

I want to create an empty array the same length as markerList (i.e., the same number of frames) in which every element is the same size as the largest frame in markerList. Some important caveats: first,I want to save the results into a .mat file where the final array (which I'll call finalStack) is a cell of cells. Second, I need to be able to reference and assign to any specific part of finalStack. So if I want to move a point to finalStack[0][22], I need to be able to do so without conflict. This basically just means I can't use append methods anywhere, but it's also unearthed my first problem - finding a way to create finalStack that doesn't cause every new assignment to be duplicated throughout the entire parent list. I've tried to do this a few different ways, and none work correctly.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Attempts at a solution:</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Following another SO question, I attempted to create finalStack iteratively, but to no avail. I created the following function:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>def createFinalStack(numMarkers, numPoints, frames):\\n    step = [[0]*numPoints for x in xrange(numMarkers)]\\n    finalStack = [step]*frames\\n    return finalStack\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>However, this causes all assignments to be copied across the parent list, such that assigning <code>finalStack[0][12]</code> leads to <code>finalStack[2][12] == finalStack[20][12] == finalStack[0][12]</code>. In this example, numMarkers= 40, numPoints = 2 (just x &amp; y), and frames= 200. (So the final array should be 200 x 40 x 2.)</p>\\n\\n<p>That said, this seems like the most straightforward way to do what I want, I just can't get past the copy error (I know it's a reference issue, I just don't know how to avoid it in this context).</p>\\n\\n<p>Another seemingly simple solution would be to copy markerList using <code>copy.deepcopy(markerList)</code>, and pad any frames with less than 40 markers to get them to numMarkers = 40, and zero out anything else. But I can't come up with a good way to cycle through all of the frames, add points in the correct format, and then empty out everything else. </p>\\n\\n<p>If this isn't enough information to work with, I can try to provide greater context and some other not-good-methods that didn't work at all. I've been stuck on this long enough that I'm convinced the solution is horribly simple, and I'm just missing the obvious. I hope you can prove me right!</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks!</p>\\n\",\n",

I\\'ve had success with <a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cssutils/\">the cssutils package</a>.  You\\'ll have a much easier time than trying to come up with regular expressions to match any possible CSS you might find in the wild.  </p>\\n\\n<p>For example:</p>\\n\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import cssutils\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; css = \\'width:150px;height:50px;float:right;\\'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = cssutils.parseStyle(css)\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.width\\nu\\'150px\\'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.height\\nu\\'50px\\'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.keys()\\n[u\\'width\\', u\\'height\\', u\\'float\\']\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.cssText\\nu\\'width: 150px;\\\\nheight: 50px;\\\\nfloat: right\\'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; del s[\\'width\\']\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s.cssText\\nu\\'height: 50px;\\\\nfloat: right\\'\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>So, using this you can pretty easily extract and manipulate the CSS properties you want and plug them into the HTML directly with BeautifulSoup.  Be a little careful of the newline characters that pop up in the <code>cssText</code> attribute, though.

Mainly when you want to modify the content somehow without disrupting the original array. Also in some cases it might be useful to copy an non-contigious array to a contiguous array before you run a computationally intensive algorithm on the data. That being said, your current code assumes the data is already contiguous so in the non-contiguous case it would just give the wrong result, copy or no copy.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you\\'re going to use pointer access to numpy arrays, you almost always want to use <code>double[::1]</code> instead of <code>double[:]</code> so that cython inserts an error checking step to make sure the array is contiguous.</p>\\n\\n<p>Also if you\\'re going to copy the content of a numpy array into some other data structure, (ie a c array or a malloc memory block) you need to declare/allocate enough memory in order to do that.

This does not give you the package name, but it's as good as that for finding out where the log message originated. The downside is that you'd need to modify every logging call in your application.</p>\\n\\n<p>Two, make a subclass of <code>logging.Logger</code> which overrides the <code>Logger.log</code> instance method. In your new <code>log</code> method, use the <code>inspect.stack()</code> and <code>inspect.getframeinfo()</code> methods to find the stack frame which caused the call to <code>log</code> in your code and extract filename and line numbers. You can then modify the log message which was passed in accordingly. Finally, tell the <code>logging</code> module to use your subclass by calling <code>logging.setLoggerClass()</code>.</p>\\n\"},\n",

A sentiment lexicon is a dictionary of words, in which each word has a corresponding sentiment score (ranging from very negative to very positive) or as you mentioned a tag such as good or bad (But the later is uncommon). There are several sentiment lexicons that you could use, such as sentiwordnet, sentistrength, and AFINN just to name a few. In all three of these lexicons you get sentiment scores corresponding to each sentiment word, and ofcourse, you can simply set a condition that if a word has a corresponding negative score its bad and if a positive one its good. \\nThe easiest to use among these is AFINN which I recommend you to start with.

Skipping all convoluted theoretical aspects, the explanation is: it fails to compile because <em>\"the type of the for loop\"</em> does not match the type involved as part of the continuation. I\\'m afraid this explanation is a complete failure. Let me try again:</p>\\n\\n<p>If you had coded something like shown below, it would compile fine:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>def myGenerator = generator {\\n  _yield(\"Financials\")\\n  _yield(\"Materials\")\\n  _yield(\"Technology\")\\n  _yield(\"Utilities\")\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This code compiles because the generator can be <em>decomposed</em> in a sequence of <code>yield</code>s and, in this case, a <code>yield</code> matches the type involved in the continuation. To be more precise, the code can be decomposed onto chained blocks, where each block ends with a <code>yield</code>. Just for the sake of clarification, we can think that the sequence of <code>yield</code>s could be expressed like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>{ some code here; _yield(\"Financials\")\\n    { some other code here; _yield(\"Materials\")\\n        { eventually even some more code here; _yield(\"Technology\")\\n            { ok, fine, youve got the idea, right?; _yield(\"Utilities\") }}}}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Again, without going deep into convoluted theory, the point is that, after a <code>yield</code> you need to provide another block that ends with a <code>yield</code>, or close the chain otherwise. This is what we are doing in the pseudo-code above: after the <code>yield</code> we are opening another block which in turn ends with a <code>yield</code> followed by another <code>yield</code> which in turn ends with another <code>yield</code>, and so on. Obviously this thing must end at some point. Then the only thing we are allowed to do is closing the entire chain.</p>\\n\\n<p>OK. But... how we can <code>yield</code> multiple pieces of information? The answer is a little obscure but makes a lot of sense after you know the answer: we need to employ tail recursion, and the the last statement of a block must be a <code>yield</code>.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>  def myGenerator = generator {\\n    def tailrec(seq: Seq[String]): Unit @Gen[String] = {\\n      if (!seq.isEmpty) {\\n        _yield(seq.head)\\n        tailrec(seq.tail)\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\n    val list = List(\"Financials\", \"Materials\", \"Technology\", \"Utilities\")\\n    tailrec(list)\\n  }\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Let\\'s analyze what\\'s going on here:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>Our generator function <code>myGenerator</code> contains some logic that obtains that generates information. In this example, we simply use a sequence of strings.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Our generator function <code>myGenerator</code> calls a recursive function which is responsible for <code>yield</code>-ing multiple pieces of information, obtained from our sequence of strings.</p></li>\\n<li><p>The recursive function <strong>must be declared before use</strong>, otherwise the compiler crashes.</p></li>\\n<li><p>The recursive function <code>tailrec</code> provides the tail recursion we need.</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>The rule of thumb here is simple: substitute a for loop with a recursive function, as demonstrated above.</p>\\n\\n<p>Notice that <code>tailrec</code> is just a convenient name we found, for the sake of clarification. In particular, <code>tailrec</code> does not need to be the last statement of our generator function; not necessarily. The only restriction is that you have to provide a sequence of blocks which match the type of an <code>yield</code>, like shown below:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>  def myGenerator = generator {\\n\\n    def tailrec(seq: Seq[String]): Unit @Gen[String] = {\\n      if (!seq.isEmpty) {\\n        _yield(seq.head)\\n        tailrec(seq.tail)\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\n    _yield(\"Before the first call\")\\n    _yield(\"OK... not yet...\")\\n    _yield(\"Ready... steady... go\")\\n\\n    val list = List(\"Financials\", \"Materials\", \"Technology\", \"Utilities\")\\n    tailrec(list)\\n\\n    _yield(\"done\")\\n    _yield(\"long life and prosperity\")\\n  }\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>One step further, you must be imagining how real life applications look like, in particular if you are employing several generators. It would be a good idea if you find a way to <em>standardize</em> your generators around a single pattern that demonstrates to be convenient for most circumstances.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let\\'s examine the example below.

Whenever two eigenvalues (corresponding to energy levels) cross each other in time, what happens to my plot is that the line that is drawn automatically switches. So the lowest energy level is for example always drawn as a solid line, even though at one point what was initially the lowest level becomes the second-to-lowest one and the initial second-to-lowest (maybe drawn as a dashed line) then is the lowest level. So you can see in the plot where the solid line would be supposed to become the second-to-lowest and the dashed should be the lowest, but at that point the lines \"exchange\" style.</p>\\n\\n<p>My idea for fixing the problem was something to like calculating the slope of the lines and rearrange the elements of the results for each point in time accordingly so that for example the first item in each sublist would correspond to what was initially the lowest eigenvalue. But I couldn\\'t find an easy and systematic way to do this in spite of having looked for similar problems all over the internet, so I really hope someone has maybe had a similar problem and found some feasible solution for it.</p>\\n',\n",

You don't actually need the item index to reference the item in the current iteration. For example:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in n:\\n...   print item\\n...\\n(1.1, 5)\\n(2.4, 7)\\n(5.4, 6)\\n(9.8, 14)\\n(10, 4)\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; # let's get each part of the tuple separately:\\n... for item in n:\\n...   print 'tuple index 0:', item[0],\\n...   print 'tuple index 1:', item[1]\\n...\\ntuple index 0: 1.1 tuple index 1: 5\\ntuple index 0: 2.4 tuple index 1: 7\\ntuple index 0: 5.4 tuple index 1: 6\\ntuple index 0: 9.8 tuple index 1: 14\\ntuple index 0: 10 tuple index 1: 4\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Now take a look at the part:<br>\\n<code>k.append(('%f', {'num' : '%d'})) % n[i][0] % n[i][1]</code> - looks like you were trying to do the <code>%</code> substitution like in <code>print '%s world!' % 'hello'</code> => <code>hello world!</code>. For that to work, you need to use the % operator immediately after the string, like so:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; k = []\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in n:\\n...   k.append(('%f' % item[0], {'num': '%d' % item[1]}))\\n...\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; k\\n[('1.100000', {'num': '5'}), ('2.400000', {'num': '7'}), ('5.400000', {'num': '6'}), ('9.800000', {'num': '14'}), ('10.000000', {'num': '4'}\\n)]\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Now, instead of doing the <code>%</code> format stuff, just cast your floats and ints to strings, using <code>str()</code>. So adapting your version with these here:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; k = []\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in n:\\n...   k.append((str(item[0]), {'num': str(item[1])}))\\n...\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>And since you know <code>item</code> refers to each element in the list, and each those is always a tuple, you can expand it in the iterator-variables, like <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> used here:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; k = []\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for x, y in n:\\n...   print 'index 0:', x, '; index 1', y\\n...   k.append((str(x), {'num': str(y)}))\\n...\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Lastly, the pattern of creating an empty list <code>k</code> and then appending items to it in a loop can be done in a more <em>Pythonic</em> way in list comprehensions:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; k = [(str(x), {'num': str(y)}) for x, y in n]\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>(Note that <code>k</code> <em>does not</em> first need to be initialised to an empty list.)</p>\\n\"}]},\n",

Depending on your personality, you may like to work from the top down or the bottom up. With this problem, I'll go with the top-down solution. At it's most broad, you simply want to run the application until the user says they want to quit. Here's a simple program that does that:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>wants_to_continue = True\\nwhile wants_to_continue:\\n    answer = input('Would you like to continue?

You're first checking to see if it <em>looks</em> like a valid GTIN, and then you're checking to see if it's actually found. But if you <em>instead</em> load the valid GTIN values first then you can actually just do it all in one fell swoop.</p>\\n\\n<p>Knowing that, then, I would re-frame your objectives:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Read the data from the CSV file and convert it to useful format</li>\\n<li>Ask the user for a valid GTIN #</li>\\n<li>Ask the user for a valid quantity</li>\\n<li>Compute and display the total price</li>\\n<li>Ask the user if they'd like to repeat</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Knowing that we're going to load your data first, here's one way to do that:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>import csv\\n\\nprices = {}\\nwith open('prices.csv') as f:  # or ChocolateCSV.csv\\n    for row in csv.DictReader(f):\\n        prices[row['GTIN']] = row\\n    # You could replace this, and the prices = {} with\\n    # a dict comprehension\\n    # prices = {row['GTIN']:row for row in csv.DictReader(f)}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Unless you have a <em>massive</em> product database (several hundred thousand products - even 100k would be fine to do this way on a reasonable computer), this approach will be totally fine. Now that you have your data it's time to get a GTIN # from the user and see if it exists:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code># Assuming that the prices were loaded by this point\\n\\nwants_to_continue = True\\nwhile wants_to_continue:\\n    answer = input('Would you like to continue?

I tried reading through the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/\">official documentation on the subject</a> but found it a little bit confusing as a beginner, i then tried googling but i noticed that most of the guides or stackoverflow answers differed slightly and i realised i needed a better understanding. Bit cheeky to ask but, could someone explain and summarise the process to me?</p>\\n\\n<p>For reference, here is my project folder hierarchy. At the moment i\\'m trying to get the template <code>base.html</code> to use the sylesheet at <code>CSS/base.css</code>:\\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vcWJv.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Also one of the things that keeps throwing me off is the use of absolute filepaths. So far i\\'ve managed to get away with just using relative filepaths, which makes more sense to me as the aim is to develop on the django test server then transfer it all onto my own server when i have one. (note: perhaps it\\'s because i have no idea how complicated that transfer process is that i don\\'t understand why absolute filepaths are prefered). What\\'s the issue with using relative filepaths?</p>\\n\\n<p>I realise that this has sort of become two questions, which is against the rules, but i really think both could be answered together and if i understood one it would probably aid my understanding of the other.

       "    'Body': '<p>I\\'m going to assume you\\'re using Django 1.3 or higher as that allows you to use <code>staticfiles</code> (<a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/staticfiles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">docs</a>) for static files. Here\\'s the basic idea: each Django website consists of multiple apps (directories) that contain all the files needed for a particular part of the website (i.e., a <code>models.py</code>, <code>views.py</code>, a <code>templates</code> directory and also a <code>static</code> directory). This <code>static</code> directory contains the JavaScript and CSS files (as well as other static files for that app.</p>\\n\\n<p>When deploying the website, you run the <code>collectstatic</code> command to gather all the static files into one directory. From that directory you then serve the static files to visitors of your site (i.e, Apache or a different web server can do that for you).</p>\\n\\n<p>So the general structure of your web project could be:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>manage.py</li>\\n<li>website/models.py</li>\\n<li>website/views.py</li>\\n<li>website/static/website/css/base.css</li>\\n<li>website/static/website/js/base.js</li>\\n<li>website/templates/website/base.html</li>\\n<li>static</li>\\n<li>settings.py</li>\\n<li>urls.py</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>You\\'ll notice that the name of the Django app is repeated in the subdirectories of the <code>static</code> and <code>templates</code> directories. This is necessary because it keeps the files apart when they are moved to a general <code>static</code> directory. In the above example, the <code>STATIC_ROOT</code> is the top-level <code>static</code> directory and into this directory all your static files will be copied.</p>\\n\\n<p>It\\'s definitely worth reading the documentation of <code>staticfiles</code> as this project layout allows you to reuse Django apps in other projects with ease. For example, you can imagine a website that looks like this:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>blog/models.py</li>\\n<li>blog/templates/blog/overview.html</li>\\n<li>blog/templates/blog/post.html</li>\\n<li>blog/urls.py</li>\\n<li>blog/views.py</li>\\n<li>photos/models.py</li>\\n<li>photos/templates/photos/overview.html</li>\\n<li>photos/templates/photos/photo.html</li>\\n<li>photos/urls.py</li>\\n<li>photos/views.py</li>\\n<li>manage.py</li>\\n<li>static</li>\\n<li>settings.py</li>\\n<li>urls.py</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The apps <code>blog</code> and <code>photos</code> can now easily be reused in other websites if desired.</p>\\n'},\n",

So I asked around and have sinister_user_name from reddit to thank for this, which I thought might help someone else:</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>Static files have changed a fair bit in recent releases so old blogs might be a bit of a mess.</p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'ll give it a shot:</p>\\n\\n<p>In your templates you can use the <code>static_url</code> tag and django will fill in the path for you.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}css/bootstrap.min.css\"&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>It fills in the static url by looking at your settings file. <code>STATIC_URL</code> defaults to <code>/static/</code> I think in settings? If static files end up in a weird url on your corporate web server you can just change it in settings anyway and it will reflect in all templates. So it doesn\\'t matter if they are absolute.</p>\\n\\n<p>When you go to deploy you fill in <code>STATIC_ROOT</code> in your settings, this is just the path that you\\'ve set your webserver to find the static files. Then if you run <code>manage.py collectstatic</code> and it will copy them to that directory. That\\'s the only function of <code>STATIC_ROOT</code> I think.</p>\\n\\n<p>I keep the template directory separate from my static directory, mainly because you want your webserver just to serve static files, while templates are processed by python. So, static files are almost not part of your application as far as the web server views them. I keep my templates and static files in separate paths just in the base directory, mainly because both are not python source files.</p>\\n\\n<p>So my project structure would be like:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>manage.py\\nwebsite/settings.py\\napp/models.py\\napp/views.py\\ntemplates/base.html\\nstatic/js/jquery.js\\nstatic/css/bootstrap.css\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The problem with relative paths is that they will need to change if your url scheme changes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Optional: I found in this blog which helps to not put absolute file system paths into the settings.py which is good if your working from multiple machines eg work and home :(\\nWith the slightly different layout for 1.4 I use this at the top of my settings:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>import os\\nimport django\\nimport manage\\n\\nDJANGO_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(django.__file__))\\nSITE_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(manage.__file__))\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>instead of what they suggest (the location of settings has moved in 1.4 or 1.3) so <code>SITE_ROOT</code> is messed up. I think that might work.\\nFurther on down in the settings I use this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code># Additional locations of static files\\nSTATICFILES_DIRS = (\\n    os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, \\'static\\'),\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This will tell the development server where to find the static files. You can do the same for templates or just use the full file path.</p>\\n'},\n",

When I try to log some specific info that the subclass has but the parent doesn\\'t, it throws an error saying that it can\\'t find that info. </p>\\n\\n<p>e.g. </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class Parent(polymodel.PolyModel):\\n    def someMethod(self, params):\\n        pass\\n\\nclass Child(Parent):\\n    def someMethod(self, params):\\n        {{logic}}\\n        return something\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The second problem I found, as a result of trying to solve the first, is that the \\'class_name()\\' method, which is reported to exist here: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/articles/polymodel\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cloud.google.com/appengine/articles/polymodel</a>,\\ndoes not seem to work.  </p>\\n\\n<p>When I call it, I get a server error that ends with <code>AttributeError: \\'Parent\\' object has no attribute \\'class_name\\'</code>. My class is not actually called \\'Parent\\', I just wanted to keep consistent with my earlier example. </p>\\n\\n<p>It\\'s all very frustrating, and I don\\'t really know how to proceed. Any help appreciated! </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Here is perhaps a more detailed description of what is happening:</p>\\n\\n<p>I have defined a polymodel class that I do not want to instantiate; I only want it to serve as a template class. It has template methods that I want to be defined in all of it\\'s children; all are <code>pass</code>. It lives in my main models file </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class Template(polymodel.PolyModel):\\n    def method_one(self):\\n        logging.error(\"ENTERED TEMPLATE METHOD, THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN\")\\n        pass\\n\\n    def method_two(self):\\n        logging.error(\"ENTERED TEMPLATE METHOD, THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN\")\\n        pass\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>In another file, lets call it template_extension_models.py, in the same directory as the main models file, I\\'ve defined an extension of the Template model that populates it\\'s methods with real logic.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class TemplateExtension(Template):\\n    def method_one(self):\\n       \"\"\"\\n       some logic specific to this class, actually\\n       takes inputs and returns something\\n       \"\"\"\\n\\n    def method_two(self):\\n       \"\"\"\\n       some logic specific to this class, actually\\n       takes inputs and returns something\\n       \"\"\"\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Back in the main models file, we have certain classes that have ndb.KeyProperties that point to \\'Template\\'. The hope/assumption is that this will act like other inheritance models, and so when we pull from the datastore an entity of type/subtype of \\'Template\\', we can call it\\'s method_one() and method_two() and the code for that specific instance\\'s method_one and method_two will run. i.e.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code> class OtherThing(ndb.Model):\\n     template = ndb.KeyProperty(kind=Template)\\n\\n     def get_template_and_call_method(self):\\n         template = self.template.get()\\n         res = template.method_one()\\n         do_something_with(res)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Here is where my problem is happening. We never actually use Template; for each instance of \\'OtherThing\\', we are actually assigning an instance of TemplateExtension. Yet, randomly, <strong>not every time</strong>, after pulling out the template in OtherThing\\'s method (a generalization of several places in my actual code), I see the method of the Template parent class being called instead of the TemplateExtension class, which causes a ton of errors. Since this doesn\\'t happen every time, I\\'m not sure where to begin looking for the problem. </p>\\n',\n",

       "    'Body': '<p>Question 1 - unfortunately you can\\'t use fused types there. (See previous questions on the subject: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13400469/c-class-in-fused-type\">c++ class in fused type</a>; <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31436593/cython-templates-in-python-class-wrappers\">Cython: templates in python class wrappers</a>). You have to create a separate wrapper for each different variant. e.g.:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>cdef class PyFc2ParInt:\\n  cdef Fc2Par[int]* thisptr\\n  # etc ...\\n\\ncdef class PyFc2ParDouble:\\n  cdef Fc2Par[double]* thisptr\\n  # etc ...\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This unfortunately involves a lot of unavoidable code duplication.</p>\\n\\n<p>Question 2. The implementation if <code>convert_points</code> essentially involves iterating through a Python list creating your boxes and then iterating through the vector to create a Python list. A rough outline is:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>def convert_points(self, points):\\n   cdef vector[Box[double]] v # or vector[Box[int]]\\n   for p in points:\\n      # I\\'ve taken a guess at what the Box constructor looks like\\n      v.push_back(Box[double](p[0],p[1],p[2],p[3]))\\n\\n   v = self.thisptr.convert_points(v) # reuse v for the output\\n\\n   # now iterate through the vector and copy out\\n   # I\\'ve taken a guess at the interface of Box\\n   output = [ (v[i].left, v[i].right, v[i].top, v[i].bottom)\\n              for i in range(v.size()) ]\\n   return output\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Note that you need to have told Cython about <code>Box</code> (<code>cdef extern from ...</code>), even if you don\\'t then expose it to Python.</p>\\n'}]},\n",

It\\'s easiest if you want to just feed in all the input at once, wait until it\\'s done, then process all the output, but obviously that\\'s not your case here, so it\\'s a bit more involved:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>minecraft = subprocess.Popen([\\'java\\', \\'path/to/minecraft_server.jar\\', \\'-other\\', \\'args],\\n                             stdin=subprocess.PIPE, \\n                             stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m merging stdout and stderr together into one pipe; if you want to read them separately, or send stderr to /dev/null, or whatever, see the docs; it\\'s all pretty simple. While we\\'re making assumptions here, I\\'m going to assume that <code>minecraft_server</code> uses a simple line-based protocol, where every command, every response, and every info message is exactly one line (that is, under 1K of text ending in a <code>\\\\n</code>).</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, to send it input, you just do this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>minecraft.stdin.write(\\'Make me a sandwich\\\\n\\')\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Or, in Python 3.x:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>minecraft.stdin.write(b\\'Make me a sandwich\\\\n\\')\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>To read its output, you do this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>response = minecraft.stdout.readline()\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>That works just like a regular file. But note that it works like a <em>binary</em> file. In Python 2.x, the only difference is that newlines don\\'t get automatically converted, but in Python 3.x, it means you can only write <code>bytes</code> (and compatible objects), not <code>str</code>s, and you will receive <code>bytes</code> back. There are good reasons for that, but if you want to get pipes that act like text files instead, see the <code>universal_newlines</code> (and possibly <code>bufsize</code>) arguments under <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#frequently-used-arguments\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frequently Used Arguments</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>Popen</code> Constructor</a>.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>Also, it works like a <em>blocking</em> file. With a regular file, this rarely matters, but with a pipe, it\\'s quite possible that there will be data later, but there isn\\'t data yet (because the server hasn\\'t written it yet). So, if there is no output yet (or not a complete line\\'s worth, since I used <code>readline()</code>), your thread just blocks, waiting until there is.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you don\\'t want that, you probably want to create another thread to service stdout. And its function can actually look pretty similar to what you\\'ve got:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>def listener():\\n    for line in minecraft.stdout:\\n        if line.strip() == \"Server can\\'t keep up!\":\\n            minecraft.stdin.write(\"Restart Universe\\\\n\")\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Now that thread can block all day and there\\'s no problem, because your other threads are still going.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>Well, not quite <em>no</em> problem. </p>\\n\\n<p>First it\\'s going to be hard to cleanly shut down your program. </p>\\n\\n<p>More seriously, the pipes between processes have a fixed size; if you don\\'t service stdout fast enough, or the child doesn\\'t service stdin fast enough, the pipe can block. And, the way I\\'ve written things, if the stdin pipe blocks, we\\'ll be blocked forever in that <code>stdin.write</code> and won\\'t get to the next read off <code>stdout</code>, so that can block too, and suddenly we\\'re both waiting on each other forever.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can solve this by having another thread to service stdout. The <code>subprocess</code> module itself includes an example, in the <a href=\"https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.4/Lib/subprocess.py#l1175\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>Popen._communicate</code></a> function used by all the higher-level functions. (Make sure to look at Python 3.3 or later, because earlier versions had bugs.)</p>\\n\\n<p>If you\\'re in Python 3.4+ (or 3.3 with a backport off PyPI), you can instead use <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-subprocess.html#asyncio.create_subprocess_exec\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>asyncio</code></a> to rewrite your program around an event loop and handle the input and output the same way you\\'d write a reactor-based network server. That\\'s what all the cool kids are doing in 2017, but back in late 2014 many people still thought it looked new and scary.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>If all of this is sounding like a lot more work than you signed on for, you may want to consider using <a href=\"https://pexpect.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>pexpect</code></a>, which wraps up a lot of the tedious details, and makes some simplifying assumptions that are probably true in your case.</p>\\n'}]},\n",

For streaming jobs, even if you use pluggable input/output like it\\'s mentioned <a href=\"http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.15.2/streaming.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, you are limited to the key and value(s) to your mapper/reducer being a text/string.

Your Pig scripts WILL tend to be much smaller than an equivalent task written any of the other languages</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>When to NOT use pig ? </p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Even though pig is pretty good at figuring out by itself how many maps/reduce and when to spawn a map or reduce and a myriad of such things, if you are dead sure how many maps/reduce you need and you have some very specific computation you need to do within your Map/reduce functions and you are very specific about performance, then you should consider deploying your own jars. This <a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigPerformance\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a> shows that pig can lag native hadoop M/R in performance. You could also take a look at writing your own Pig <a href=\"http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.7.0/udf.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">UDFs</a> which isolate some compute intensive function (and possibly even use JNI to call some native C/C++ code within the UDF)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>A Note on IO and CPU bound jobs :</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Technically speaking, the whole point of hadoop and map reduce is to parallelize compute intensive functions, so i\\'d presume your map and reduce jobs are compute intensive. The only time the Hadoop subsystem is busy doing IO is in between the map and reduce phase when data is sent across the network. Also if you have large amount of data and you have manually configured too few maps and reduces resulting in spills to disk (although too many tasks will results in too much time spent starting / stopping JVMs and too many small files). A streaming Job would also have the additional overhead of starting a Python/Perl VM and have data being copied to and fro between the JVM and the scripting VM. </li>\\n</ul>\\n'}]},\n",

       "    'Body': '<p><em>I\\'m a bit conflicted about writing answers like these - it seems like just producing a complete solution with very little didactic value, but I\\'ve tried to make it as generally helpful as possible...</em></p>\\n\\n<p>If I understand what you\\'re trying to do correctly, you want to turn your <code>data</code> into CSV where there is one row for each user.  There are a range of dates and you want one column for each date - that column indicates the status of the user on that date.  Then there are columns that produce the totals for each status across every date, and so on.  The output you\\'ve quoted looks most like CSV with tabs as separators, although as eumiro points out, it isn\\'t exactly.  However, let\\'s assume that you want to write tab-separated data.  It\\'s not clear from your question what should happen if you discover in <code>data</code> that a user has two different statuses for one day, so let\\'s check for that and throw an exception.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Note that everything in the last paragraph really should be in your question, along with the code from your best attempt so far.</em></p>\\n\\n<p>So, using <code>DictWriter</code> from the csv module is a reasonable idea, but to use that class you need a dictionary for each line which maps the column headings to values.  So, you could iterate over everything in <code>data</code> to produce a dictionary of dictionaries, mapping a user to the dictionary that represents the row for that user.  You could do that with something like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict\\nimport csv\\nfrom datetime import date\\n\\nuser_to_row = defaultdict(dict)\\n\\nfor d in data:\\n    user = d[\\'user\\']\\n    status = d[\\'status\\']\\n    row_dict = user_to_row[user]\\n    row_dict[\\'user\\'] = user\\n    date_string = str(d[\\'date\\'])\\n    if date_string in d and row_dict[date_string] != status:\\n        raise Exception, \"Contradiction: \\'%s\\' on \\'%s\\'\" % (user,date_string)\\n    row_dict[date_string] = status\\n    # If a value isn\\'t set in one of the total columns yet, set it to 0:\\n    row_dict.setdefault(\\'p-total\\',0)\\n    row_dict.setdefault(\\'E-total\\',0)\\n    row_dict.setdefault(\\'total\\',0)\\n    # Make sure you increment the right column:\\n    count_column = \\'p-total\\' if (status == \\'P\\') else \\'E-total\\'\\n    row_dict[count_column] += 1\\n    # And increment the overall total column in any case:\\n    row_dict[\\'total\\'] += 1\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>You should check that you understand what\\'s going on in there - try printing <code>user_to_row</code> to check that you understand what is being produced.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now you just need to loop over the values in the <code>user_to_row</code> dictionary and output them with DictWriter.  The thing to be careful with here is that you\\'re not sure that there will be an entry for every date, so in this case I\\'ve just inserted <code>Unknown</code> when a value is missing:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>with open(\"hello.csv\",\"w\") as f:\\n\\n    # Create the headings:\\n    headings = [\\'S.no\\']\\n    headings += [str(date(2011,2,i)) for i in xrange(6,11)]\\n    headings += [\\'user\\', \\'date_format\\',\\'p-total\\',\\'E-total\\',\\'total\\']\\n\\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, headings, delimiter=\"\\\\t\")\\n\\n    # The writeheader method only appeared in Python 2.7, so write the\\n    # headings from a dictionary that maps each heading to itself:\\n    writer.writerow(dict(zip(headings,headings)))\\n\\n    # Assume that S.no is just a row number...\\n    sno = 1\\n    for d in user_to_row.values():\\n        d[\\'S.no\\'] = sno\\n        # Fill in any unknown values with \\'Unknown\\':\\n        for h in headings:\\n            d.setdefault(h,\\'Unknown\\')\\n        writer.writerow(d)\\n        sno += 1\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The documentation for the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html\">csv module</a> should give you all the extra information you need to understand that part.</p>\\n\\n<p>The output then looks like:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>S.no    2011-02-06  2011-02-07  2011-02-08  2011-02-09  2011-02-10  user    date_format p-total E-total total\\n1   Unknown Unknown P   P   P   xxx Unknown 3   0   3\\n2   Unknown Unknown P   E   P   yyy Unknown 2   1   3\\n3   Unknown Unknown P   E   P   zzz Unknown 2   1   3\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>... which looks odd here because of the tabs, but would load into a spreadsheet correctly.</p>\\n'}]},\n",

Here is an answer based on what interface the objects implement, instead of what they \"declare\". </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Short answer:</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>A \"container\" as you call it, ie a list/tuple that can be iterated over more than once as opposed to being a generator that will be exhausted, will typically implement both <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__getitem__</code>. Hence you can do this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def is_container_iterable(o):\\n...     return hasattr(o, \\'__iter__\\') and hasattr(o, \\'__getitem__\\')\\n... \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable([])\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(())\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable({})\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(range(5))\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(iter([]))\\nFalse\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p><strong>Long answer:</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>However, you can make an iterable that will not be exhausted and do not support <strong>getitem</strong>.   For example, a function that generates prime-numbers. You could repeat the generation many times if you want, but having a function to retrieve the 1065th prime would take a lot of calculation, so you may not want to support that. :-)</p>\\n\\n<p>So is there any more \"reliable\" way? </p>\\n\\n<p>Well, all iterables will implement an <code>__iter__</code> function that will return an iterator. The iterators will have a <code>__next__</code> function. This is what is used when iterating over it. Calling <code>__next__</code> repeatedly will in the end exhaust the iterator.</p>\\n\\n<p>So if it has a <code>__next__</code> function it is an iterator, and will be exhausted.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():\\n...    for x in range(5):\\n...        yield x\\n... \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f = foo()\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f.__next__\\n&lt;method-wrapper \\'__next__\\' of generator object at 0xb73c02d4&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Iterables that are not yet iterators will not have a <code>__next__</code> function, but will implement a <code>__iter__</code> function, that will return an iterable:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; r = range(5)\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.__next__\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\\nAttributeError: \\'range\\' object has no attribute \\'__next__\\'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ri = iter(r)\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ri.__next__\\n&lt;method-wrapper \\'__next__\\' of range_iterator object at 0xb73bef80&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>So you can check that the object has <code>__iter__</code> but that it does not have <code>__next__</code>.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def is_container_iterable(o):\\n...     return hasattr(o, \\'__iter__\\') and not hasattr(o, \\'__next__\\')\\n... \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(())\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable([])\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable({})\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(range(5))\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(iter(range(5)))\\nFalse\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Iterators also has an <code>__iter__</code> function, that will return self.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; iter(f) is f\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; iter(r) is r\\nFalse\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; iter(ri) is ri\\nTrue\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Hence, you can do these variations of the checking:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def is_container_iterable(o):\\n...     return iter(o) is not o\\n... \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable([])\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(())\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable({})\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(range(5))\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(iter([]))\\nFalse\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>That would fail if you implement an object that returns a broken iterator, one that does <em>not</em> return self when you call iter() on it again. But then your (or a third-party modules) code is actually doing things wrong.</p>\\n\\n<p>It does depends on making an iterator though, and hence calling the objects <code>__iter__</code>, which in theory may have side-effects, while the above hasattr calls should not have side effects. OK, so it calls <strong>getattribute</strong> which could have. But you can fix that thusly:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def is_container_iterable(o):\\n...     try:\\n...         object.__getattribute__(o, \\'__iter__\\')\\n...     except AttributeError:\\n...         return False\\n...     try:\\n...         object.__getattribute__(o, \\'__next__\\')\\n...     except AttributeError:\\n...         return True\\n...     return False\\n... \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable([])\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(())\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable({})\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(range(5))\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is_container_iterable(iter(range(5)))\\nFalse\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This one is reasonably safe, and should work in all cases except if the object generates <code>__next__</code> or <code>__iter__</code> dynamically on <code>__getattribute__</code> calls, but if you do that you are insane. :-)</p>\\n\\n<p>Instinctively my preferred version would be <code>iter(o) is o</code>, but I haven\\'t ever needed to do this, so that\\'s not based on experience.</p>\\n'}]},\n",

       "    'Body': '<p>I glanced over your implementation and it looks like it should work (in most practical cases) now that you have edited it to contain the <code>message</code> function definition. I briefly tested the implementation you posted after your edit and it worked for me during two test runs.</p>\\n\\n<p>Although it worked for me, I would not say that it is completely foolproof as is. When I tested it, I tested it in a quiet channel that was not flooding the socket with a high volume of data. Judging by the name of the channel you included in your code (<code>\"#TwitchPlaysFightingGames\"</code>), I suspect that you may be joining this rudimentary Twitch IRC client into a channel that is continuously pushing a high volume of data. The case I am about to describe touches on why this might be an issue for you.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Divided Message Issue</h2>\\n\\n<p>The one obvious problem I see involves how you are handling the data you are receiving from your call to <code>socket.recv()</code>. Your code receives a hard-coded finite amount of data per call to the socket receive function and then assumes that it will always contain one full \"message\", so to speak. In your case, the \"message\" you are interested in is <code>\"!test\"</code> Depending on various factors including the latency between calls to <code>socket.recv()</code> and the received packet length(s), it is possible for your \"message\"-inspection logic to fail when a single \"message\" is divided across two calls to <code>socket.recv()</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the following simplified snippet of code, consider what would happen if the socket\\'s buffer contained the data <code>\"[x][y:1]\"</code>:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>while True:\\n  response = socket.recv(5)\\n  if response.find(\"[y:1]\") != -1:\\n    print(\"success\")\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>During the first iteration, <code>response</code> would be equal to <code>\"[x][y\"</code>. During the second iteration, <code>response</code> would be equal to <code>\":1]\"</code>. Neither of these iterations would contain the message <code>\"[y:1]\"</code>. In this example, <code>\"success\"</code> would never be printed. This is a significantly scaled down version of the problem I described above.</p>\\n\\n<p>That said, if you wanted to create a completely foolproof implementation, you may consider building a separate buffer to house unparsed pieces of \"messages\". For instance, in the example above, if you parse the message <code>\"[x]\"</code> and keep the remainder of the receive buffer (<code>\"[y\"</code>) in a separate unparsed message buffer, you can later join the content of the next receive buffer with the unparsed message buffer to yield the full \"message\" (in this case, <code>\"[y:1]\"</code>).</p>\\n\\n<h2>Potential <code>IndexError</code> Exception Issue</h2>\\n\\n<p>Another issue is that you are performing string split operations and immediately attempting to access an index of a list that may not contain any elements. You would know when this happens, because the attempt would raise an <code>IndexError</code> exception. I am guessing this is not happening to you, because you did not mention any exceptions.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Advice For Debugging Your Issue</h2>\\n\\n<p>Because I could not easily reproduce your issue, it may help to have more information about your situation. I would start by testing the code in a quiet channel. Next, you should consider saving a second copy of the code and simplifying it so that you can narrow down the issue, if it still persists.</p>\\n\\n<p>Consider removing the following code to simplify your problem:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>remove the call to <code>queuetimer()</code> as well as its function definition and any other references to the <code>queue</code> variable</li>\\n<li>simplify the <code>message()</code> function so that it only calls <code>irc.send()</code></li>\\n<li>remove the <code>data.split()</code> and <code>user.split()</code> lines, since you are not using them</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>If you still cannot figure out what the problem is, post back to this thread with any additional information you uncover.</p>\\n\\n<h2>An Additional Twitch.TV IRC Client Example</h2>\\n\\n<p>I figured it might help for you to see an example of what it may entail to take some steps toward parsing more of the Twitch.TV IRC protocol; so, I uploaded a quick demonstration application to GitHub with this in mind: see <a href=\"https://github.com/jwilges/twitchtvircclient\">https://github.com/jwilges/twitchtvircclient</a> for the demonstration code.</p>\\n'}]},\n",

Let\\'s start iterating then. (<code>x = _i.next()</code> ... <code>x = _i.next()</code>...)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Since Mr. <code>obj</code> succeeded in this test (by having certain method returning a valid iterator), we reward him with adjective: you can now call him \"iterable Mr. <code>obj</code>\".</p>\\n\\n<p>However, in simple cases, you don\\'t normally benefit from having iterator and iterable separately.  So you define <em>only one</em> object, which is also its own iterator.  (Python does not really care that <code>_i</code> handed out by <code>obj</code> wasn\\'t all that shiny, but just the <code>obj</code> itself.) </p>\\n\\n<p>This is why in most examples I\\'ve seen (and what had been confusing me over and over),\\nyou can see:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class IterableExample(object):\\n\\n    def __iter__(self):\\n        return self\\n\\n    def next(self):\\n        pass\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>instead of</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class Iterator(object):\\n    def next(self):\\n        pass\\n\\nclass Iterable(object):\\n    def __iter__(self):\\n        return Iterator()\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>There are cases, though, when you can benefit from having iterator separated from the iterable, such as when you want to have one row of items, but more \"cursors\".  For example when you want to work with \"current\" and \"forthcoming\" elements, you can have separate iterators for both.

If some CPU heavy process starts in the background on your computer and causes your game to no longer be able to churn out 60 frames a second, it\\'s probably preferable for it to slow down, rather then have your objects start skipping huge distances between frames.

My reason for this is two-fold: I have many <code>plt.plot()</code> lines in my code and would rather not go back and have to change it for all of them, and then I wouldn\\'t have logarithmically spaced minor ticks (although I\\'m sure there\\'s some way to change that even with a linear axis).</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  I am aware of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6431248/matplotlib-logarithmic-scale-but-require-non-logarithmic-labels\">this question</a> which has some similarities to mine but is not the same.  The person in that question wants to change the tick labels from scientific form to \"normal\" decimal form.  I want to change my tick labels from scientific form to the logarithmic (base 10) value of the number.  I am sure the answer will be similar to the one I linked but it is not obvious to me how to do it.

The specialized <code>fromXXX</code> methods can preprocess different types of input to convert them into the form they need to be in to pass to that canonical instantiation.  The idea is that you call <code>Text.fromFiles(...)</code> to make a <code>Text</code> from filenames, or <code>Text.fromSentences(...)</code> to  make a <code>Text</code> from sentence objects.</p>\\n\\n<p>It can also be acceptable to do some simple type-checking if you just want to accept one of a few enumerable kinds of input.  For instance, it\\'s not uncommon for a class to accept either a filename (as a string) or a file object.  In that case you\\'d do:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>def __init__(self, file):\\n    if isinstance(file, basestring):\\n        # If a string filename was passed in, open the file before proceeding\\n        file = open(file)\\n    # Now you can handle file as a file object\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This becomes unwieldy if you have many different types of input to handle, but if it\\'s something relatively contained like this (e.g., an object or the string \"name\" that can be used to get that object), it can be simpler than the first method I showed.</p>\\n'},\n",

When your python code hits the <code>settrace</code> it connects to the server - pycharm - and starts feeding it the debug data.</p>\\n\\n<p>To make this happen:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>1. copy the <code>pydev</code> library to the remote machine</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>So I had to copy the file from <code>C:\\\\Program Files\\\\JetBrains\\\\PyCharm 1.5.3\\\\pycharm-debug.egg</code> to my linux machine. I put it at <code>/home/john/api-dependancies/pycharm-debug.egg</code></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>2. Put the egg in the PYTHONPATH</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Hopefully you appreciate that you\\'re not going to be able to use the egg unless python can find it. I guess most people use easy_install but in my instance I added it explicitly by putting this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>   import sys\\n   sys.path.append(\\'/home/john/app-dependancies/pycharm-debug.egg\\')\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This is only necessary because I\\'ve still had no success installing an egg.

So the virtual (remote) machine has to be able to reach the host.  <code>ping</code> and <code>netstat</code> are good for this.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Port</strong>: can be any vacant non-priviledged port you like. eg: <code>21000</code> is unlikely to be in use.</p>\\n\\n<p>Don\\'t worry about the path mappings for now.</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><strong>4. Start the debug server</strong></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>Run</em>-> <em>Debug</em> : start the debug server - choose the configuration you just created.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The debug console tab will appear and you should get </p>\\n\\n<pre><code> Starting debug server at port 21000\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>in the console which means that the ide debug server is waiting for your code to open a connection to it.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>5. Insert the code</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>This works inside a unit test:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>from django.test import TestCase\\nclass APITestCase(TestCase):\\n    def test_remote_debug(self):\\n        import sys\\n        sys.path.append(\\'/home/john/dependancies/pycharm-debug.egg\\')\\n        from pydev import pydevd\\n        pydevd.settrace(\\'192.168.33.1\\', port=21000, suspend=False)\\n\\n        print \"foo\"\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>And in a django web application it\\'s a bit finicky about where you put it - seems to work only after everything else is done:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>if __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"settings\")\\n    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\\n    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\\n\\n    sys.path.append(\\'/vagrant/pycharm-debug.egg\\')\\n    import pydevd\\n    pydevd.settrace(\\'192.168.33.1\\', port=21000, suspend=False)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Again that the IP address is the box where you\\'re running Pycharm on; you should be able to ping that ip address from the box running your code/website.  The port is your choice, just make sure you\\'ve told pycharm to listen on the same port.  And I found the <code>suspend=False</code> less problematic than the defaults of, not only immediately halting so you\\'re not sure if it\\'s working, but also trying to stream to stdin/out which might give you grief also.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>6. Open the firewall</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Windows 7 firewall will, by default, block your incoming connection. Using netstat on the remote host you\\'ll be able to see that SYN_SENT never becomes ESTABLISHED, at least not until you add an exception to the windows firewall for the application \\'pycharm\\'.</p>\\n\\n<p>OS/X and Ubuntu do not have firewalls to punch threw (by default, someone may have applied one later).</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>7. Set a breakpoint and run the code</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>After all that, when everything goes to plan, you can set a breakpoint - somewhere after the settrace has run - and pycharm console will show</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>Connected to pydev debugger (build 107.386)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>and under the \\'Debugger\\' tab the variables stack will start working and you can step through the code.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>8.

I know the obvious solution is to ditch XML-RPC, but I don\\'t think that\\'s possible for this device, as I have no control over implementing any other protocols from the \"server\". This also makes it impossible to do a MultiCall, as I can not add valid instructions for MultiCall. Does MultiCall have to be implemented server side? For example, if I have method1(), method2(), and method3() all implemented by the server already, should this block of code work to execute them all in one reply? I\\'d assume no from my testing so far, as <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/library/xmlrpclib.html#multicall-objects\" rel=\"nofollow\">the documentation</a> shows examples where I need to initialize commands on the server side. </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>server=xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(serverURL)\\nmulticall=xmlrpclib.MultiCall(server)\\nmulticall.method1()\\nmulticall.method2()\\nmutlicall.method3()\\nmulticall()\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Also, looking through the source of xmlrpclib, I see references to a \"FastParser\" as opposed to a default one that is used. However, I can not determine how to enable this parser over the default. Additionally, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/3343497/546311\">the comment on this answer</a> mentions that it parses one character at a time.

If the device can handle multiple requests at once, then this may be of benefit.

It may be that larger files are triggering garbage collection more frequently, but the small files are being freed but collectively staying at some threshold.

For example, change the bash for loop for a larger range, something like: <code>seq 0 16 2056</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p>You noticed the memory usage was reduced if you <code>del mystr</code> because you are removing any references left to it.

If you used Windows LowFragmentationHeap instead, it would probably not leak, similar on AIX, depending on which malloc is configured. Maybe one of the other allocators (tcmalloc etc.) also fix such issues. sbrk() is blazingly fast, but has issues with memory fragmentation.

The simplest solution is to use a frame, pack the scrollbar on the right and the listbox on the left, and then you can treat the whole frame+listbox+scrollbar as a single widget within the rest of the GUI. This is a very common technique.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, if you insist on using <code>place</code> and only <code>place</code>, and want it next to the listbox, the best choice is to use a combination of relative and absolute positioning. </p>\\n\\n<p>With relative positioning you can tell place \"put this next to this other widget\", and not have to worry about the exact coordinates yourself. You can also tell place to make the widget exactly as tall (or wide) as some other widget, or exactly some fraction of a size of another widget. In your case you want the scrollbar to be exactly as tall as the listbox.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here is a complete working example which builds on your code:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>from Tkinter import *\\nroot = Tk()\\nroot.geometry(\"800x800\")\\ndata = Listbox(root, width=33, height=15,bg=\\'grey\\',fg=\\'black\\')\\ndata.place(x=381,y=158)\\n# create a vertical scrollbar to the right of the data\\nyscroll = Scrollbar(command=data.yview, orient=VERTICAL)\\n\\nyscroll.place(relx=1.0, y=0.0, relheight=1.0, \\n              bordermode=\"outside\", in_=data)\\n\\ndata.configure(yscrollcommand=yscroll.set)\\n#data.bind(\\'&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;\\',openDoc)\\n\\n#test function for  listbox\\ndef populate():\\n    for i in range(1,50):\\n        data.insert(\\'end\\',\\'number is: \\'+str(i))\\npopulate()\\n\\nroot.mainloop()\\n</code></pre>\\n'},\n",

If not, is this problem in NP?</p>\\n\\n<p>Code to solve the problem written in Python:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>def can_factorize_in_list(n, list):\\n    # Determines whether it is possible to factorize 'n' in 'list'\\n    # Filter the list to only include the values which are factors\\n    fac_list = [p for p in list if (n % p is 0)]\\n    for x in fac_list:\\n        if n % x is 0:\\n            if n/x is 1:\\n                # If we end up at 1, we have a valid factorization\\n                return 1 # End state\\n            else:\\n                # If we do not end at 1, keep trying\\n                if can_factorize_in_list(n/x, fac_list):\\n                    return 1\\n                else:\\n                    continue\\n    return 0\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>EDIT: For instance, given integer 30 and list [2,3,5,8], the algorithm should return True because 30 = 2*3*5. It is not required to use all the elements in the list as factors and factors can be used more than once.</p>\\n\",\n",

Pick any <code>M</code> which is an upper bound on <code>(c[i]-c[j])**2</code> This is easily done in linear time since the min and the max of the list can be computed in a single pass, in which case <code>M = (max - min)**2</code> works.

The notation has been introduced with <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0358/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PEP 358</a> for Python 2 as a step towards the migration to unicode support. The current <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2.6/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals\" rel=\"nofollow\">Python syntax for 2.6 does not mention the <code>b</code> prefix</a> while the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals\" rel=\"nofollow\">Python syntax for 2.7 does mention the <code>b</code> prefix</a>. However, PEP 358 was intended for Python 2.6 and all Python 2.6 interpreters which I have seen accept it.</p>\\n\\n<p>With the migration to Python 3, the <em>default</em> for string literals changed from <em>byte</em> to <em>unicode</em>. However, the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2.6/library/__future__.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>__future__</code> module</a> was introduced to ease migration. The following illustrates the effect with respect to string literals.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Dec 26 2010, 22:31:48) \\n[GCC 4.4.5] on linux2\\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \\'abc\\'\\n\\'abc\\'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b\\'abc\\'\\n\\'abc\\'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import unicode_literals\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \\'abc\\'\\nu\\'abc\\'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b\\'abc\\'\\n\\'abc\\'\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>I hope I could motivate that the following statements have a limited validity:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>In Python 3 this denotes a byte literal</em>: Yes, but also in Python 2 at least since version 2.6.</li>\\n<li><em>This notation is ignored in Python 2</em>: It is more that it has no effect <em>if</em> you have a Python 2 version which already supports it and <em>unless</em> you (or the foreign code you look at) imports <code>__future__</code> <em>and only</em> if you do not care about compatibility with Python 3 (which <em>everyone</em> should consider and which is often aimed at in third party software).</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The shortest valid answer to the OP\\'s question, in my view, would be:</p>\\n\\n<p><em>This is a prefix for string literals, enforcing byte representation as opposed to unicode representation, introduced in Python 2.6, not changing the Python default for Python 2</em> (but deserves attention if <code>from __future__ import</code> can be seen).</p>\\n'}]},\n",

This value can either be an exception \\n  instance to be raised, or a value to be returned from the call to the\\n  mock (<code>DEFAULT</code> handling is identical to the function case).</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Therefore, your <code>socket.create_connection</code> mock will <em>return</em> the <em>function</em> <code>oddConnect</code> for the first two calls, then <em>return</em> the <code>Mock</code> object for the last call. From what I understand, you want to mock <code>create_connection</code> object to actually call those functions as side effects rather than returning them.</p>\\n\\n<p>I find this behavior rather odd, since you\\'d expect <code>side_effect</code>, to mean <code>side_effect</code> in every case, <em>not</em> <code>return_value</code>. I suppose the reason this is so lies in the fact that the value of the <code>return_value</code> property must be interpreted as-is. For instance, if your Mock had <code>return_value=[1, 2, 3]</code>, would your Mock return <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> for <em>every</em> call, or would it return <code>1</code> for the first call?</p>\\n\\n<h2>Solution</h2>\\n\\n<p>Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. According to the docs, if you pass a single function to <code>side_effect</code>, then that function will be <em>called</em> (not returned) <em>every time</em> the mock is called.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>If you pass in a function it will be called with same arguments as the\\n  mock and unless the function returns the <code>DEFAULT</code> singleton the call to\\n  the mock will then return whatever the function returns. If the function\\n  returns <code>DEFAULT</code> then the mock will return its normal value (from the\\n  <code>return_value</code>).</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Therefore, in order to achieve the desired effect, your <code>side_effect</code> function must do something different every time it is called. You can easily achieve this with a counter and some conditional logic in your function. Note that in order for this to work, your counter must exist outside the scope of the function, so the counter isn\\'t reset when the function exits.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>import mock\\nimport socket\\n\\n# You may wish to encapsulate times_called and oddConnect in a class\\ntimes_called = 0\\ndef oddConnect():\\n  times_called += 1\\n  # We only do something special the first two times oddConnect is called\\n  if times_called &lt;= 2:\\n    result = mock.MagicMock()  # this is where the return value would go\\n    raise socket.error  # I want it assigned but also this raised  \\n\\nsocket.create_connection = mock(spec=socket.create_connection,\\n  side_effect=oddConnect)\\n# what I want: call my function twice, and on the third time return normally\\n# what I get: two function objects returned and then the normal return\\n\\nfor _ in xrange(3):\\n  result = None\\n  try:\\n    # this is the context in which I want the oddConnect function call\\n    # to be called (not above when creating the list)\\n    result = socket.create_connection()\\n  except socket.error:\\n    if result is not None:\\n      # I should get here twice\\n      result.close()\\n      result = None\\n  if result is not None:\\n    # happy days we have a connection\\n    # I should get here the third time\\n    pass\\n</code></pre>\\n'}]},\n",

The .exe wrapper installed from the Wheel file unzipped into a directory containing a simple <strong>main</strong>.py script, </p>\\n\\n<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\\nimport re\\nimport sys\\n\\nfrom example_multiprocessing.runner import main\\n\\nif __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r\\'(-script\\\\.pyw|\\\\.exe)?$\\', \\'\\', sys.argv[0])\\n    sys.exit(main())\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>It was just a python script ran from a zip file. No wonder it blew up. </p>\\n\\n<p>I re-installed using setup.py, adding back the old wrapper .exe, and tried to unzip that. Lo and behold it is a full on Portable Executable file with .data, .pdata, .rdata, and .text sections extracted into their own files by 7zip. Two hours later, I\\'ve dug through distutils and setuptools source code to find out what is going on there, and find that the .exe I am seeing is made by pouring some entry point specific python code into a pre-canned launcher exe made for Windows. Great. I know more than I did before. But if the difference was the .exe wrapper, why does the -script.py entry_point work?</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>__requires__ = \\'example-multiprocessing==1.0.2\\'\\nimport sys\\nfrom pkg_resources import load_entry_point\\n\\nif __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n    sys.exit(\\n        load_entry_point(\\'example-multiprocessing==1.0.2\\', \\'console_scripts\\', \\'example-mp-run\\')()\\n    )\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Is <code>load_entry_point</code> special? It is a wrapper around EntryPoint.load(), which is used to explicitly call <code>__import__</code>:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code># From [https://bitbucket.org/pypa/pkg_resources/src/33e56f318f5086158de8bb2827acb55db2dbc153/pkg_resources.py?at=default#cl-2258][1]\\ndef load(self, require=True, env=None, installer=None):\\n    if require: self.require(env, installer)\\n    entry = __import__(self.module_name, globals(),globals(), [\\'__name__\\'])\\n    for attr in self.attrs:\\n        try:\\n            entry = getattr(entry,attr)\\n        except AttributeError:\\n            raise ImportError(\"%r has no %r attribute\" % (entry,attr))\\n    return entry\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The <code>globals()</code> look like a dead end from the documentation of <code>__import__</code>, but  the <code>[\\'__name__\\']</code> looks like it may be useful. The trouble is that <code>__import__</code> is a built-in, and it is implemented in C. I\\'ve tried to read the mirror posted on <a href=\"https://github.com/python-git/python/blob/715a6e5035bb21ac49382772076ec4c630d6e960/Python/import.c\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a>, but it is beyond my ken at the moment, forking into three or more interacting functions, which I can\\'t trace and keep a connection with fromlist. I may also be getting distracted by <code>__import__</code> since the next block after it tries to access a attribute of the module stored in <code>entry</code>, which I infer to be the entry point function itself.</p>\\n\\n<p>When I run the following code:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>getattr(__import__(\"example_multiprocessing.runner\", globals(), globals(), [\"__name__\"]), \"main\")()\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>I do see the main function I expected to run execute in, and return without issue. </p>\\n\\n<p>Is <code>__import__</code> really doing the work I need, setting the <code>__name__</code> of the script to something not including <code>__main__</code>? Why doesn\\'t runpy, the machinery behind -m work?</p>\\n',\n",

About the only method where that\\'s the case is CGI, and it\\'ll run like a dog.</p>\\n\\n<p>Speaking in <em>very</em> general terms, there are two ways Django can be run. Either it runs inside a process of the web server itself - as with mod_wsgi on Apache - or it runs in a completely separate process and receives requests via reverse proxy from the server, as with uwsgi/gunicorn. Either way, the lifetime of the Django process is not directly connected with the request, but is persistent across many requests. In the case of mod_wsgi for example, the server starts up threads and/or processes (depending on the configuration) and each one lasts for a large number of consecutive requests before being killed and restarted.</p>\\n\\n<p>For each process, this means that any modules that have been loaded stay in memory for the lifetime of the process.

Imagine what it could mean for a Python program that even number objects could change value over time... you would be forced to play tricks like</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class Shape:\\n    def __init__(self, points):\\n        self.points = points[:] # make a copy of the list\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>not only for lists and dicts, but also for numeric values and strings.</p>\\n\\n<p>So basically in Python some types have immutable instances because they normally are used as \"values\" and you don\\'t care about identity.

       "    'Body': '<p>First off, it\\'s not clear what <code>PyExecute</code> actually is; it isn\\'t provided by Python itself. I\\'ve found one library out there that provides things called <code>PyInit</code> and <code>PyExecute</code> -- it offers Python integration for something called Metatrader -- and I\\'m going to guess that that\\'s what you\\'re using. Even if you\\'re not, what you\\'re actually using may be similar enough for what follows still to make sense.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, anyway, what you\\'re doing now certainly can\\'t be right: what do you expect the Python interpreter to do when you tell it to execute <code>while True:</code>? The only possible answers are (1) an infinite loop with an empty loop body, and (2) nothing until you\\'ve somehow provided the loop body <em>and told it you\\'ve finished doing so</em>. The first of those subdivides into (1a) do nothing useful because it\\'s a syntax error and (1b) loop for ever doing nothing. None of these outcomes is going to be any use to you. (I am pretty sure the actual answer is either (1a) or (1b) but haven\\'t checked which.)</p>\\n\\n<p>What you actually need to do is to provide <code>PyExecute</code> -- which I think is a thin wrapper around the actually-part-of-Python <code>PyRun_SimpleString</code> -- with a complete statement to execute. That would be the whole loop. So give it the whole thing, including newlines <em>and indentation</em>, and see if that behaves better.</p>\\n\\n<p>I emphasized \"and indentation\" there because as it stands your code is wrongly indented, and in Python indentation is actually used by the parser. The relevant bit probably wants to be something like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>while True:\\n    data = s.recv(4096)\\n    if data.find ( \\'PING\\' ) != -1:\\n        s.send ( \\'PONG \\' + data.split() [ 1 ] + \\'\\\\r\\\\n\\' )\\n    if data.find ( \\'You need to send your password. Try /quote PASS &lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;\\' ) != -1:\\n        s.send (\\'PASS \\' + zncauth + \\' \\\\r\\\\n\\')\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The stuff before the loop, being just one statement per line, is probably fine as it is.</p>\\n\\n<p>To clarify what I meant by \"give it the whole thing\": you need a <em>single</em> string containing the multi-line code, something like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>PyExecute(\\n    \"while True:\\\\n\"\\n    \"  data = s.recv(4096)\\\\n\"\\n    \"  if (data.find(\\'PING\\') != -1:\\\\n\"\\n    \"    s.send(\\'PONG\\' + data.split()[1] + \\'\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\')\\\\n\"\\n    ...)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>where</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>each line ends with an explicit <code>\\\\n</code></li>\\n<li>each line is appropriately indented with spaces at the start</li>\\n<li>I\\'ve used C\\'s automatic-concatenation feature where if you write a bunch of <code>\"...\"</code> strings with only whitespace between them they get treated as a single longer string; if you\\'re actually writing in some other C-like language and it happens not to support that syntax then the code will look a bit uglier</li>\\n<li>backslashes inside the code are escaped (again I\\'m assuming C syntax for strings, which may or may not be correct if you\\'re using a different language)</li>\\n</ul>\\n'}]},\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>I\\'m using Traits 4 to build a simple interactive GUI application. This application will display a timestamped log of events in a dedicated part of the GUI. This log is currently stored as a String trait.</p>\\n\\n<p>The default editor (or View? Not sure on the exact nomenclature) for a String trait is a scrollable multi-line display widget. When the internal string value is changed, the widget updates to display the new value. If the length of the content exceeds the viewable size of the widget, then a scrollbar appears to allow the user to scroll up and down, across the entire value.</p>\\n\\n<p>It appears that when the widget refreshes and a vertical scrollbar is then visible (content exceeds widget size), the view resets to the start of the value (top), and the scrollbar returns to the top also, obscuring the final part of the value.</p>\\n\\n<p>In my application I wish the latest event in the log (at the bottom) to always be displayed after a value refresh. But because the view resets to the top of the value, it doesn\\'t follow the latest entry and the user must constantly scroll to the bottom after each refresh. This is unusable in this form.</p>\\n\\n<p>Is there a simple way to configure this trait\\'s editor/View to scroll from the bottom?</p>\\n\\n<p>If not, how would one go about writing a custom editor/View for this String trait?
